Lo and behold, his lavender honey fried chicken tops its spicy cousin. The chicken is brined in buttermilk, dredged in seasoned flour and sits for ten minutes. It's then coated with a second round of flour and dropped into the fryer. The chicken (breast, wing, thigh, drumstick) is drizzled with lavender honey and sprinkled with salt and ground pink peppercorns. It comes with a buttermilk biscuit, whipped honey-thyme butter, and red bliss potato salad. It is some of the best fried chicken I've eaten in a long time. Crunchy, crispy coating on the outside with a juicy, moist inside. The sweet honey glaze is truly outstanding and finger lickin' good. The biscuit is awesome. I would definitely order this dish again and again. I got the salty but delicious fried smelts with chili pepper aioli as an appetizer. My friend Chris W got the filet mignon and butter poached king crab surf and turf. For dessert, I had a slice of salted pecan pie and he had the ice cream sundae. Every dish at Juniper Commons was top-notch. Chef Sbraga does it again!",0,5kcLlhJPLJL_GLwrAdbZAA

I had biked passed 16th Street Seafood a ton of times, always wondering what was going on inside.  Now I know the answer, and the answer is- not much. At least in terms of decor. There is a gumball machine, 2 empty candy machines, plus a counter to order at and that's pretty much it. Also absent was the plethora of seafood over ice you would hope to see at a place specializing in seafood. There were some frozen crab cakes, breaded fish fillets, clams, and crabs- but not else. Still, I threw caution to the winds of Tasker Street and put in an order.\n\nI didn't want to go for fried seafood, so the sandwiches and platters were out.\n\nI got a large order of mussels in butter and garlic sauce ($9.50). Mussels are one of those things I like making at home, but it is way too hot for that right now. . My main complaint is that the order came with an unacceptable amount of closed shells - 9!   It was still a good sized order with a big piece of bread to dip in the unexpectedly spicy, broth. As the place is to-go only- they know how to wrap up messy seafood orders, nothing was spilled.\n\nRemember when I said I didn't want anything fried, well that's not ever actually true.

I think the first time I tried this place, it may have been in part because the line at Dinic's was unbearably long and the throngs of people waiting were spilling over into Beck's stall space (they are next to each other)... and boy am I glad my inner fatty couldn't wait another minute because I just don't know what I'd do without this jumbalaya! \n\nI will note that the service here is a bit terrible. Don't get me wrong - everyone is very nice, but ... SLOW-moving. VERY slow moving. I have never seen a more inefficient operation in my life, but like I said, they are super pleasant and helpful so you forgive them for taking 10+ minutes to pack  your order and collect payment (note: I've been there at least 4x and it's been true every single time). \n\nAs an example of the employees' niceness/helpfulness, as an FYI, they do let you sample pretty much any of the entrees so you can make sure it's not too spicy or too peppery etc for you.\n\nAlso, no credit card machine here so bring CASH.\n\nWHAT WE ATE\n*Jumbalaya: perfect. perfect. AND it's surprisingly spicy! It's less saucy then some jumbalayas I have had, but still really flavorful and the rice is perfectly cooked. They also usually spoon on a bit of sauce on top and adds that extra flavor. IF you get the right cashier, she will upsell you the cornbread - GET IT - and eat it TOGETHER. They're not messing around when they say the cornbread + jumbalaya flavors complement each other like whoa.  \n\n*Etouffee - the flavors of the bell peppers were a bit TOO strong for my personal liking, but I could appreciate the complexity of the flavors and the spiciness here as well. My friends really liked this dish, so I did want to mention. \n\n*Oyster Po'Boy - I thought the fried oyster was great. The breading they use to coat the po boy sandwich meats (and oysters) are really tasty and not overwhelming. I wish there was more oyster in the sandwich itself, but that would be the only complaint. \n\n*Beignets - warm and delightfully light fried dough and generous dusting of powdered sugar make this dessert just decadent enough. \n\n*Praline cookies - these were decent, but not the best I've ever had. The color was a bit darker than I was used to (more coffee with a splash of milk rather than latte color) and it almost tasted like they had burned/overcooked the butter or brown sugar. \n\nBeck's also has this authentic root beer from New Orleans available. I'm not a root beer fan so haven't tried, but I keep hearing awesome things about it.",3,jwmMWvA_yTjXbzK0ErnEOA

That being said, because our experience at R2L was so anomalous, I felt I had to warn people about the service. \n\nWhile the food was good, and the view was wonderful, we had an unfortunate experience. At the beginning of our meal, the waitress was friendly and built a rapport with us. However, there was an unfortunate incident where someone (not our server) on the waitstaff knocked a glass of water on one of us and spilled our bottle of wine on the floor. No wine got on either of us, and we were very understanding - mistakes happen. We get it. Here's where problems arose. \n\nWhat great service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled and comp something trivial, like a desert or app. \n\nWhat reasonable service would have been: Provide a glass of wine promptly to make up for the amount spilled. \n\nWhat actually, unfortunately, happened: The waitstaff gave us a bunch of napkins and apologized a couple of times. One of about three people hurriedly cleaning us up promised us 2 extra glasses to make up for the wine that had soaked into the carpet. Finally, the gentleman who made the mistake was very apologetic. Up until this point - totally fine. \n\nThen, after a few minutes of everyone, including our formerly-friendly server, avoiding us like they heard there was a sudden outbreak of the Zika virus at our table, our server finally resurfaced to refill water. When one of us asked whether that wine was coming out (after all, someone we hadn't met before promised it then disappeared), rather than reassuring us, this was the response, verbatim: ""You didn't finish the bottle yet. We were going to bring it out when you finished the bottle."" Excuse me? \n\nAfter the flippant response, our waitstaff's avoidant behavior continued. We finished our bottle of wine with dinner, then ordered a dessert (hey, maybe this would give them a chance to be reminded by the wine stain in the carpet that they promised to compensate us for our overpriced loss with a glass?).  Frustrated, we asked for the check. After our waitress ran our card, FINALLY, upon returning our check, she poured our two drinks, without speaking a word to us, as we were about to leave. \n\nWe expected better from a such a supposedly classy establishment.

Please note, it's not like we called at 2:28 for lunch, it was a reasonable 11:45 or so.  Second, delivery was ridiculously late, maybe being from NYC I have higher expectations so I'll give them a pass on that...maybe.  Third and the final straw, the food was HORRIBLE!!!!! I don't even understand how they felt that what they sent out was acceptable.  How does a Dominican restaurant screw the most basic thing-Rice.  It was stale and crunchy...and not in a bibimbap way....which I love but not with my chicken stew that was void of everything but chicken.  The only redeeming item were the sweet plantains and I assume that was because it didn't require much intervention from the chef.  \nWas this just an unusually bad day for a restaurant that thus far has been pretty good?

We were a quasi, unofficial bachelor party for my wife's nephew and probably the strangest and most unlikely grouping for a ""wolf pack"" ever, but that is another story. The inside is pretty cool and with the tiles, pillows, decor it seemed almost as if we had walked into someone's house in Morocco. The staff was super friendly and very polite and explained Marrakesh has been open for 30 years. Middle Eastern music and Moroccan pop songs played softy in the back ground.\n\nThe food on the whole was  good. As others has explained the menu is more or less prix fixed and the choices are limited. The staff gives you some modification options but not much. The only down point food wise was our beef kebab was tough and over cooked. Everything else, especially for a bulk serving style was very good. To check out Marrakesh's menu on their webpage http://www.marrakesheastcoast.com/menu.pdf\n\nMarrakesh has a belly dancer on Friday and Saturday nights and that was interesting. One of our group was Egyptian and he said she was quite outstanding. I wouldn't know good belly dancing from bad, so I can't really confirm. The dancing was tasteful and not raunchy.\n\nOne other thing of note is that with some Mid Eastern and North African cuisines, silver ware is in absentia. Guests are encouraged to eat with their hands as the custom in Morocco. All adding to a unique and sometimes a slightly messy experience.\n\nThe pricing was pretty reasonable, we were a little under $50.00  per person with 2-3  beers each and gratuity included. Marrakesh does have a small beer and limited drink menu. Marrakesh was doing a brisk business with groups like ours, well no group was quite like ours, but with large parties anyway. Marrakesh is cash only.\n\nTo end the night, we were served fruits, baklava and mint tea. It was really a cool place and we all had a good time.

I have been here a few times both pre and post Eli Collins, and I have to say its still just as good as its always been. They make one of the best bloody marys in the city as well as an always delicious burger. It may have changed a bit, but its still awesome. We took a few friends here to celebrate their engagement recently, and everything really worked out nicely.\n\nWe started with a few cocktails, classic mule made with rye for me, and we settled in to a steady conversation of wedding planning and stories of engagement nights. The cocktail was delicious, even with the change from standard vodka in a moscow mule to the rye. The ginger beer and lime combo is bomb.\n\nSo many things on the menu caught my eye, but the one we all seemed enticed by was the whiskey and sage bread with ramp butter. We ordered one for the table and I ordered the pulled pork shoulder sandwich. The bread came out warm and covered in a flour ""pabbit"" the mascot of Pub and Kitchen. It was served on a slate dish with a smear of ramp butter that was deeply satisfying. I could have eaten the entire loaf all by myself. The butter was superb and you could definitely taste the whiskey in the bread.\n\nI was a little bit disappointed when my pulled pork sandwich came out though. When I think of pulled pork, I think BBQ style. Had the sandwich description read porchetta or something of that nature, I would have expected what I got. That being saidm the sandwich was really tasty, an ode to the Philly staple of roast italian pork. It was super messy, I am talking juice running down your arms while you are chomping down messy, but in such a good way. I devoured the entire thing. So tasty. The fries are just as I remembered them, fantastic. They were super crispy.\n\nWe even ordered a dessert to share for the table. It was one for the ages, one of the most delicious panna cottas I have ever had. It was a vanilla cardamom panna cotta covered in a mango sauce. It was the most perfectly textured panna cotta I have ever seen. It had just the right amount of jiggle, so that it quivered in its dish when it was set down on the table. The cardamom was just powerful enough to really bring another level of flavor to it, but not overpower the vanilla in any way. Outstanding. Pub and Kitchen is just as good as its ever been.

Typically I'm hesitant when trying korean fusion dishes as I often feel like the flavors aren't handled properly when trying to americanize or change traditional korean foods (or maybe I'm just a korean food snob? or both??) but I must say... I loved my experience at Southgate this past weekend! \n\nI started brunch off with their kimchi blood mary, which was spicy! I was actually very happy with the spice level but also how they use kimchi to elevate the bloody mary. I didn't think it was too overwhelming which was what I was embracing for. I enjoyed the spicy house-made soju shot that it was paired with as well. It was like a nice little cool down break from the kimchi Bloody Mary :)\n\nMy friends and I decided to do tapas style for brunch so we could taste as many things as possible. Best idea ever! We started with the kimchi deviled eggs which were tasty. Again, I am pleased that they were able to subtly infused the kimchi within the dish, which wasn't overwhelming or overbearing by any means. But it also wasn't just adding kimchi on top of a traditional deviled egg. I believe they blended the kimchi and some sesame oil in the egg mixture which really just made the mixture smooth with a hint of sweet and spicy. They had four pieces so it's easy to share.\n\nFor our entrees, we ordered the kimchi poutine, short rib and korean fried chicken (KFC) and green tea waffles. It is hard for me to choose one clear favorite, mostly because I thoroughly enjoyed each dish. The kimchi poutine was delicious and I loved that the fries and cheese on the stone bowl continued to cook and get crispy even at our table. They don't have any gravy on this dish (like traditional poutine), but it works out very well. Very easy to share. The KFC and green tea waffles were a huge surprise to me. I wasn't expecting to enjoy the waffles that much, mostly because I wasn't too sure about green tea waffles... but it was very good! And paired with super crispy KFC was like icing on the cake. I wish the chicken was spicy though, that would have definitely put it over the top for me and been a favorite. Lastly, the short rib dish was good though it doesn't stick out as much as the other two. My friends really enjoyed the short rib itself, but I was under the impression it was suppose to be like galbi so that let me down a bit--still good but just not what I had been expecting. The short rib was placed in a huge bowl with rice, two eggs and jalapeños. The nice surprise was the sweet soy sauce at the bottom of the bowl, where the rice was soaking it up--it really brought the dish together.\n\nOverall, Southgate is a wonderful place to experiment with Korean fusion dishes. One of my friends had never had korean food before and really enjoyed our dining experience here. I like that they offer a variety of things outside what you'd expect. I will most definitely come back here for brunch the next time I'm in Center City! Especially for the spicy kimchi Bloody Mary :)",1,2pDWLhRkZa67GvNu0DWQtA

I had been here twice before for lunch - which was good but maybe only 3 or 4 stars.  \n\nLast nite's meal solidified the 4 stars.  Service was wonderful and attentive (maybe because they are slow in the summer??).  We stated with virgin Golden Pineapple Mojitos which were truly delish.  FRESH pineapple juice and mint - perfectly balanced.\n\nMy dining companion was a close friend from out of town who walked by and wanted to go here.  She is very health conscious and ordered the salmon in a light (not too salty) black bean sauce over a crsip tender bed of TERRIFIC baby bok choi.  It was accompanied by a Cocunt ""polenta"" that was so silken it tased and felt like coconut flan.  Almost dessert like.\n\nI had a started of an Ahi Tuna Sampler (which I have ordered before and I just love it.).  At $17 it is small and expensive - but the quality of the tuna tartare and the fabulous accompaniments make it somehow worth every delicious teeny morsel.\n\nInstead of an entree I had the COMPOSED  $12 salad with golden beets, candied Walnuts, sliced yellow tomatoes, microgreens in a delectable, sweet but not cloying , light vinagrette.  The salad came with 5 small goat-cheese wontons - that looked like over-stuffed tortellni.\n\nI ate 3 and gave 2 to my partner.  They really didn't do much for me.  The goat cheese inside was almost like a bleu?  Goat gorgonzola maybe?  Too strong.\n\nBut the salad and all the other compnents was terrific.\n\nIf you think Foo is past her prime or somehow not ""all that"" anymore - I urge you to give it another try.  At dinner.

We particularly loved the chicken dish because we used the steam to warm our hands when it was served. I have quite never been so cold inside a building. To top it off, when we went downstairs the first floor was empty by that time, but there was a space heater turned on. Why did they never turn on the heat? Why did they not offer to bring the space heater up to the second floor?\n\nFurthermore, there were no working bathrooms in the restaurant that night.

Ended up snagging a seat right next to the window overlooking the western part of the city. Let's be honest, the views are the whole reason people go here right? But I think the only reason we were fortunate enough to get a window seat is because we arrived here as soon as they opened up their doors at 5pm on a Sunday. (We made reservations for that slot ahead of time online thru Open Table). However, within just one hour of being there the place was packed with people so getting a window seat at that time would've been impossible...unless you put down a hefty couple hundred dollar down payment/deposit to guarantee it (at least according to their website).\n\nOverall, the food choices on the Restaurant Week menu were pretty good and tasty. Fine dining establishments aren't really my first go-to whenever I dine out, so it was a pleasant experience to change it up and order things I would otherwise never try.\n\nBut what really made R2L unique in my opinion however, are two things--the entrance experience and the service.\n\nWhen you are trying to find out where to enter Two Liberty Place you'll see a sign for R2L off of 16th street. Walk in thru that door and veer to the right--you'll see that they have their very own carpeted walkway leading up to...yep...their very own elevator; whoah!! It only goes up to the 37th floor and back down again so it's definitely theirs. It was great timing to travel up with one of their new hostess hires (Tiffany) who was so friendly and charming.\n\nWhen you first arrive in the lobby on that 37th floor, the entrance way is dimly lit mood lighting which contrasts well to the interior natural light inside the actual restaurant. As soon as you enter the main restaurant you'll feel like you're on top of the world, because, well you are and well, it's a high-class place.\n\nTiffany seated us by the window and our wonderful server, Hannah, took care of us and went that extra mile to make sure we were accommodated. Obviously she knew we weren't the typical fine diners that do this every day. People who do fine dining all the time are probably the ones complaining about the little things here. We should be thankful for what we do receive because we often take for granted how lucky we are in life. We sat there as Hurricane Irma was bombarding Florida so I got to thinking about things. Guess being so high up in the sky will encourage that sort of reflection, I dunno.\n\nHannah even went so far as to spell out the word ""congratulations"" in chocolate on my dining companion's dessert plate to honor her moving into a new apartment recently that I briefly mentioned. It's the little things that make a big difference, ya know?\n\nThe food came out super quick (probably because we were there early), but we didn't feel rushed when it started to get more crowded. An amazing experience all around. And some great photos to take back with us. You surely won't be disappointed, unless of course you're looking for something to be disappointed about.",0,tHVFAI0kemjV8Il9UjXBrw

When I made the reservation, I told them it was our first anniversary. They gave us a table with an AMAZING view of the city. Our waitress could not have been nicer- she really went out of her way to make our night special. They brought us each a glass of champagne to toast, and some challah bread with whipped butter for the table. For our appetizer, we started out with the Grilled Truffle Flatbread, which was DELICIOUS! We then each had the Romaine salad, which was also very good. For our entrees, I had the Horseradish and Pepper-rubbed Tuna Loin, and my husband who is vegetarian, had the Saffron Papardelle. For dessert, we ordered Variations of Chocolate and the Donut Ice Cream Sandwich-both of which were amazing (they even wrote ""Happy Anniversary"" in chocolate on the dessert plates). Needless to say, we were quite full when we left.\n\nFor the people who are complaining about the prices, please stop. You know going into this place that it's not the Olive Garden- hello!- it has it's own private elevator with a concierge who greets you and directs you where to go!  It's an upscale, hip restaurant that has been frequented by local celebs (Chase Utley lives in the building). You get what you pay for.\n\nWhile I don't think most people could afford to go here regularly, this is definitely a place I would return to for a special occasion. Our waitress and the rest of the staff really went out of their way to make sure we had a wonderful evening.

Last Saturday night same thing. We wanted a table away fro the door as it was chilly outside. We were told the other 4 top was reserved for a party of 6. No worries. So we eat dinner and the other table sat empty. Not until we were paying the bill did they seat a  table of 4 at that table. Not a 6 top...a 4 top....

Seating didn't take very long depending on when you arrive but the portions were slightly small for the hefty price. \n\nI grabbed the KFC which was $12 for 6. The chicken was very crunchy and more importantly, the chicken was juicy. Additionally, the sauce was sweet and not overpowering. Also grabbed a Dolsot Bibimbap (Hot Stone Pot) which was very well presented. There were a lot of vegetables and the dish stayed hot but my biggest complaint was that there was barely any flavor in the beef or from the gochujang, which was very disappointing. We also got a bulgogi burger to split. It was defiantly a interesting dish as a fusion dish. Maybe I'm more used to bulgogi with rice, but it was definitely a unique taste with how sweet the bulgogi burger was. \n\nThe place wasn't too loud and had a TV which had a game on. There is a nice outdoor seating area for the spring/summer. Overall, it was a pleasant experience. The service was good and the food was more often good.

mUIBtlWNPD7sz3rGGWQ1RA,0,2014-04-25 03:31:44,0,ZTotS0Ws2Sm8baHVOezPcA,5,"I think it's time to give a more lofty review. This is my favorite restaurant in the city. As such, I have set out on a great goal: Eat everything on the menu. You think this would be easy but with wonderful daily specials, this a difficult feat. \n\nNow dinner-wise, I do prefer the MEZE. Only because I like the surprise of it all. But here are some dinner items I have tried.\n\n1) Dips of the day: For a petite girl like myself, even when I split this with my bf, I still feel full. Usually, there is always the typical garlic hummus (which is really atypical here) and fresh twists on hummus like pumpkin. Everything is seasoned beautifully and the grilled pita that comes with it is the perfect addition.\n\n3) Greek Salad: The fresh produce carries this dish as well as the homemade dressing. Tastes like a combo of white wine vinegar, salt, lemon, and cracked pepper. But of course, I know there is something that I am missing. It may not even have these ingredients but no one is going to tell me exactly what it is. \n\n4) Poultry of the day: I think that it is cooked underneath a brick. Rottiseur chicken to the tenth power. Sometimes it may come with cauliflower and a creamy sauce underneath. \n\n5) Lemonada: Now this is truly a lemon cordial meaning it is concentrated. Depending on my mood, I add a little water to this because the flavor is so intense. I wouldn't say that it is the sugar but the lemons which makes it intense. Sometimes I just drink the thing like it's water. Again, I have my moods.\n\n6) Lemonana: I love the mix of the mint tea and lemon cordial. If you don't like mint tea, don't get this because the lemon cordial does not mask the mint by any means.  However the flavors truly complement one another.\n\n7) Cyprus Breakfast: Scared to try something new? Go with the Cyprus Breakfast. Great introduction into the brunch atmosphere here. Lounza essentially tastes like ham but it's not ham. Does that make sense :)\n\n8) Kanella Platter (Brunch): When I feel like grazing, this is what I get. The shining star to me are the grape leaves. Firm but not mushy. I hate when I get grape leaves and inside the rice is mushy. Not here. I can cut the grape leaf without it falling apart.\n\n9) The Cypriot: Classic Cypriot style ham and cheese served warm with a cucumber and tomato salad served chill. I'm a petite girl so I usually eat half of this and take the rest home for a midnight snack before going out.\n\n10) Organic pork and Sieftali kebab: This is  a lot of food for me. Especially if I know that I will delve into some of the desserts later. I won't review what I thought was outstanding in this dish because my bf was talking my ear off and I wasn't really concentrating on the food. Just stuffing my face.\n\n11) Zorba The Burger: Every time I have this, I feel like Kanella should just have a to go window or a little cart outside where they sell this, some greek chips, and lemonadas to go. When I see the Zorba come out in all of its glory, I only wish that my stomach was a bottomless pit so that I may partake in its deliciousness. Now this does not come with greek chips. Whenever I see someone order this, I see that they are somewhat surprised by this. A burger, that's it? But that's all you need when it is cooked to perfection, seasoned like no body's business and topped with a fresh yogurt and mint sauce. Think this comes with a pickle which the bf always eats.\n\n12) Lachanopita: Not feeling meaty but don't want to feel like you are missing out on meat?. This is it. A savory pie made with love.\n\n13) Baklava: Now when I get this, I swear I could eat 10 more but realize that two squares is all you need to feel satisfied. Date ice-cream is the perfect mate and not overwhelming.\n\n14) Chef's mother's coconut, date, and hazelnut cake: I would describe this as a date brownie. I don't like dates but I will eat this no problem.\n\n15)  Pagoto: Chocolate, lavendar, lemon, oh my. You never know what it will be but it is oh so good. Don't split this, make your guest order their own. \n\n\nAtmosphere: I like that there is no music here. Or is there? Kanella takes away from all my other senses and all I can do is taste. I do not dine in a group here because I need to go in on all of the food without judgement. Kostantinos is always friendly and to me, the prices are beyond fair. Every time the BF and I dine somewhere else, we feel like we are cheating on Kanella or got cheated because we end up paying more for less quality. The specials are truly special; meaning you MAY never hear them offered ever again :o. But don't fret, if the special sounds good, it is. Try something new and come back next week to order what's on the menu or another special :)",0,e4z0a6hpIPOO1TtlO0UfsA

We arrivedat 4:22 and we were starving!  The hostess sat us at a table for 2 which was so small that we didn't know how both our plates would fit on the table at the same time. I asked the hostess if we could sit at the larger table next to us and she told us no (even though at 4:30 they open up the upstairs portion of the restaurant for dinner where there were several more tables).  We sat down at our cramped table. The waitress came to take our drink order. We both ordered water. She brought us 2 glasses and some water in a glass container. it was about 80 degrees that day and the water was warm. no ice in the glasses. When we looked at the menu, we saw that it was the 'snack menu'. Apparently, you don't get a regular dinner menu until 4:30. While a little annoyed since we only had 5 mins to go, we knew we were only ordering salads so we didn't make an issue of it. We placed our order: a chopped salad and a Caesar salad, both with grilled chicken added (both were ricdiculously priced). and then we waited... and waited....and waited.... after a half an hour, we were pretty annoyed and started looking around for someone. At that point, I noticed there were 2 salads that had been sitting on the counter for quite some time. People have been walking by them, servers have been talking over them, one server was leaning against the counter right next to one of them.  Around this time the manager came over and told us that they lost our ticket and they were correcting the issue now. (i can only assume is that they basically forgot to cook our chicken, even though we were watching the cooks in the kitchen sweep, clean up and converse with each other).  At this point , even after we pointed out that we have been waiting half an hour for SALADS, the manager never offered us anything for the inconvience. Not a drink, not an appetizer, not even some bread for the table. (i should also mention that in all this time our waitress never even came back to check on us so that we could ask for some ice for our warm water). I asked the manager if the salads I have been looking at for quite some time were ours and he said 'yes'. i told him we didnt want salads that have been sitting there so long and people were talking and gesturing over. He said ""if you don't want them, then you don't have to take them"". We told him we don't want them and that we were going to go. He just walked away, no apologies, no attempt to get us to stay. \nWe definitely will not be giving this establishment another chance since it is obvious they do not value their patrons all around experience. From the minute we walked in the door, we knew we should have left. Next time we will listen to our intuition.",3,avWuT0M8e2SgKQ2phkavKA

I do this from time to time because it serves as an excellent opportunity for me to try places that aren't on my usual list.  My wife and I headed down there this past Thursday night.  We found the place easily; it was located just west of 2nd and Market. \n\nThe decor is that of your typical Philadelphia sports bar, with much of the wall decorations having been purchased at Model's.  The place was crowded, with every seat at the bar being taken.  We were able to find three high top tables near the front glass windows of the restaurant.  We grabbed the only one of the three that had two chairs (the others only having one each).  A few minutes after sitting down we noticed why the tables were vacant.  The glass windows made that whole area freezing.  I awkwardly pulled the table and chairs a few feet away from the window and under a heater.  \n\nWe waited a few minutes before a server stopped by our table with the menus and draft list.  The draft list was good. Beer snobs rejoice, this place has a very respectable list. My wife and I both went with one of our favorites, Troegs Mad Elf ($7.50).  The menu was also respectable. As vegetarians we went for the Mac's Mac-n-Cheese ($6.99), a Veggi Burger with mayo ($7.99 + $0.50) and  a Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($4.99) with fries ($5.99).  \n\nThe mac-n-cheese came out around 15-20 minutes after it was ordered, which I expected. Upon inspection, I noticed that it barely had any of those crushed BBQ chips the menu had mentioned.  Otherwise the dish was very good. The sauce was gooey and runny and after a quick stir all the pasta was once again coated in cheese sauce. I will certainly get this again should I return to Mac's. \n\nThe entrees arrived in short time after the mac-n-cheese.  When I ordered my veggie burger, I asked the waiter if he had tired it and if it was any good. He responded ""that it was O.K. and that they came in pre-made"".  Slightly less optimistic, I decided to try it anyway. It was pretty good and scalding hot.  The role was definitely handmade and the burger had a chewy, crispy texture (in part b/c it was deep fried).  I was a little disappointed that the server charged me $0.50 for mayo without telling me.  The sandwich was supposed to come with a house aioli on it, but it didn't.  My wife's grilled cheese was impressive. The cheese, which was almost a half inch thick, had been broiled to get a crispy, brown, bubbly texture before the sandwich was finished and sliced. Her small side of fries, which she requested as an add on for her sandwich was ($5.99) bringing her grilled cheese and fries to a whopping $11. \n\nI wasn't overly impressed with Mac's! Other than a few puns on their menu, I would never have guessed that the place was at all affiliated with the show (I'm a big Always Sunny fan!).  Without the show as a novelty, I was left with yet another pretentious gastropub in Old City.  I might return to Mac's if a friend visits the city and wants to go because they watch the show.

Frequently railing against on-line review sites, such as yelp, and engaging in heated verbal battles with various food critics, whether their reviews were good or bad.  The nice thing for him, is that he can get away with it.  Fearless preparation of whole branzino, pork cheeks and salty, fishy tampenades allow the simple ingredients to shine through.  I've only been here once and thoroughly enjoyed myself with similar feelings shared among all my friends that have Kanella in their regular rotation.  Go early in the week and let the chef choose for you if he is wandering the dining room and he wont let you down.",0,Mub2IDViy1Nx6ObbyMPF4w

Went to dinner at 9 pm with 2 other ladies. We were hungry so we ordered the appetizer plate, the fried halloumi and the Greek salad, thinking it would be a lot. The portions have shrunk incredibly. I didn't even see the fig puree with the halloumi, (2 pieces of cheese) but rather some onion salad. The plate we ordered was tiny, a few olives, 4 tomatoes on a skewer, some watermelon salad and feta cheese. Honestly, for what we paid for ($7 I think), I could have made this at home. \nWe were hungry after the appetizers and couldn't wait for our entrees. Mine came out and it was 5 ravioli. Mind you I am a small girl with not a large appetite, but I was disappointed. It was also really salty. My friend ordered the same thing and couldn't finish it it was so salty. I was also looking for the zucchini flowers, which was the main reason why I chose the dish, and I found one drowning in the sauce....so sad. Our bill for the 3 appetizers and 3 vegetarian entrees was over $100 and we were still hungry. I remember when we used to come here and pay way less and be stuffed. I guess popularity changes places.\nOn top of that, the service is usually great, but we had a really bland waiter who didn't explain anything, or really even seem to like his job. Made for a really forgettable experience. I'm not sure I will come back for brunch or lunch if the portions are that small for the high prices.",2,J2nRpw7vBReo2pBKCEpUVw

How could this be any less enjoyable than a free trip to DisneyWorld?\n\nMy six year old nephew was off from school for some unknown occasion, so we decided to go on an adventure. It was my understanding that chicken tickets were given out beginning at 10:45 (which made sense to me since the normal lunch rush is between 11am and 1pm), so we arrived around 10:30, appetites whetted.\n\nFail. \n\nChicken tickets aren't available until 11:45.\n\nI was slightly turned off by the very matter of fact ""chicken's not til 11:45"" response I received, rather than a mildly apologetic & explanatory ""I'm sorry but our chicken isn't ready until noon,"" but I didn't come all that way for nothing (nephew lives in Cheltenham), so, we decided to order donuts.\n\nDouble fail.\n\nFederal Donuts are fancy.\n\nI had no prior knowledge of the menu, and came in with visions of some fantastically hefty, ""old fashioned,"" ""authentic"" boston cream doughnut (yes, what i envisioned was a doughnut, not a donut) blessing my mouth and belly, and nephew just wanted a simple chocolate donut.\n\nWe sat down to eat our donuts (Appolonia Spice for me, chocolate raspberry for the little one), as I debated in my head whether or not I was willing to wait an hour for the chance to buy chicken.\n\nThe decision was made for me, as we were in the way of the people trying to put cream and sugar in their coffee, plus it began to get uncomfortable in the small space as more people trickled in to wait for chicken tickets. (You try hanging out in a silent room full of people with a 6yo.)\n\nUltimately, I thought my donut was pretty tasty, but after one bite, nephew decided to put his away ""for later."" He never even thought about that donut again, except to decline it when I offered it as an afternoon snack. I can't offer an opinion because I am repulsed by all things raspberry and didn't taste it.\n\nAs much as I wanted to love Federal Donuts, and wanted to adore the experience, the highlight of the day was nephew's excitement at seeing the NBCPhiladelphia van outside because we arrived as the Ten Show was wrapping.\n\nStill mad I missed the chicken.",3,FS9EWeUw1mWdw5cYF2Xykg

A nice bar scene, lots of guests from the attached Hotel Monaco. Bar staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about both food and drink. I had a happy hour classic old fashioned which was made with wild turkey 101. It was a pretty good drink and when priced at $6 is even better! \n\nFor dinner I decided to order the sausage of the day, pork confit and potato gratin. The sausage of the day was a Vietnamese sausage with spices and fennel served with mustard greens and a white bean puree. While I didn't care for the white bean puree the mustard greens were fantastic as was the sausage. I wish it had a little more crunch on the casing, but I think that's a personal preference. I had another old fashioned, can't turn them down at $6 did I say that already?\n\nThe pork confit and potato gratin came out next and the first two things I noticed (sadly negative) were a) the size of the gratin, it wasn't more than a 1.5x1.5"" square, would've expected more for $7, given the prices on the menu and the dishes, b) the ridiculous amount of butter on the pork confit. I can't figure out if the dish is normally served like this or this was just a one off, I have to think it's always served like this. Literally there was so much butter that it was 1/2"" in the bottom of the bowl. I ate most of the pork, which soaked up the butter decently but the noddles were amazingly oily and really not edible. I'd love to hear that this was a mistake but I fear it wasn't. The gratin suffered from the exact opposite issue. It was dry, had no cheese taste to it, honestly tasted like a Betty Crocker home bake with a little salt.\n\nI decided to skip dessert in favor of a glass of scotch from their excellent whiskey collection of bourbons, single malt and blended scotches, all priced reasonably. I had a Glenmorangie Quinta Rubin which was priced accordingly and had a generous pour.\n\nOverall, I think these guys have some great things with the house made sausages and great cocktails on the menu, but the main and side I had just weren't too great. I saw others next to me get the chicken pot pie, sirlion filet and hummus and all seemed to be pleased. As an out of towner, I probably won't get another chance to sample, but give it a shot here, even if just for a drink.",0,kaLP0wZgsGhrWMBFZEme_g

Since finding out that this place was among top 50 great restaurant / food joints in philly I had to check it out. No doubt, I love the concept: chicken & donuts who doesn't? Philadelphia chicken and donut scene was already pretty weak and needed a revamping. Being actually from South Korea, I know what KFC is all about. Tried the chili-garlic, soy-ginger, & zaa (something- dry rub) and what are  you kidding? I can't believe you guys are getting away with selling this food to customers. The chicken is no where near KFC in terms of twice-fried texture, tender meat, as well as the sauce. Federal Donuts, you've done your best to imitate it but no offense, don't call it KFC and market it that way to people here, I'm quite offended. \nOn the other hand, I gave you at least 2 star because your donuts is actually quite creative and pretty tasty.

You get two thin, stacked burgers.  I don't like the lack of juiciness in a pressed flat burger but as long as it's not over-cooked it can be good (but not great).  Mine was pink within. Good.  My friend's was well-done and hard.  They were all ordered and cooked at the same time so, given how many they make, it should be down to a science. (Or math.)  The thin fries were good, not destination fries, but good.  I liked our server, who accommodated our individual variations on their burger, but she did overlook warning me off their garlic aoli which comes on the burger even though I'd alerted her to my garlic allergy.  (I don't see a need to ever put mayonnaise on a burger -- they are fatty enough.)\n\nI will return to try other menu items that looked appealing.  Hard wood seating was surprisingly comfortable.\n\nThey do NOT offer a gluten free burger bun, just bunless burgers on a plate for the IBS-sufferer in our group. Had to ask to have it on lettuce. (P&K doesn't offer any gluten free bread option, despite this town having an excellent gluten free bakery, Taffett's, that delivers their great burger bun, baguettes, and breads to many area restaurants, including the nearby Miles' Table.  12% of US households buy gluten free products, most because of serious health reasons.  That's a big chunk of potential patrons to be refusing to accommodate. And, clearly, the waitstaff is not well versed enough in the ingredients of each dish, or I'd have been warned off the aoli when I declared a garlic allergy.)\n\nStill, giving them another shot, with my guard up.

What adds to the glamour is the southern and western views of Philadelphia, and is the kind of place where I like to take sophisticated guests to give them a bird's eye view. \n\nI've come many times with friends, co-workers, and even a lunch with the office. For the most part, I've come for the happy hour, as this is the best value. They have a seasonal rotating menu of appetizers and drink specials, along with beer and wine selections. Service is solid, and they will even give you a 2 minute head's up to place any final orders during the happy hour. \n\nI'll admit though, that I won't come here for dinner. I have a belief that restaurants perched at the top of any building are more about the view than the food. Indeed, when I perused the dinner menu on my last visit, nothing stood out from a culinary point of view, with the exception of some poor descriptions of some of their entrees. I don't believe the food here is bad, but the prices support the hefty commercial lease. \n\nIn my mind, this is the kind of place you go when you have a business account and need to impress/close the deal or for a celebration. (Their selection of vintage Champagne suggests I am correct). If it is just a regular Tuesday, go for the happy hour and feel as if you own the world, if only for 90 minutes.\n\nNote: Happy Hour lasts from 4:30-6:30.

But I'd been dying to try Kanella so we went for Valentine's Day.  They did a special menu for $65 a person with 4 courses.  We aimed to order all of the most untraditional meats possible and ended up with frog legs, rabbit, and goat chops.  The rabbit appetizer was delicious and had an amazing vegetable sauce that was really a pop of flavor.  The salad we were served were pretty traditional but very fresh and tasty. \n\n For my main course I decided to try the goat chops and I honestly cannot say enough about how amazing these were.  They were basically goat candy- the most flavorful, tender, juicy chunks of meat, cooked on the bone and surrounded by juicy fat. I did not know what to expect with this dish but I would eat those goat chops every night of my life if I could...I won't deny that I knawed on the bones after finishing the meat.  They were just that good.  I had a decadent dark chocolate dessert with lavender ice cream which was extremely tasty. \n\nAfter trying the Valentine's Day menu I really wanted to try the regular menu so I returned 6 days later to introduce a different set of people to the deliciousness of Kanella.  Again I had an excellent meal with very tasty meats and vegetables.  They were very accommodating to a friend who wasn't eating gluten and helped her find something tasty that she enjoyed greatly.  They had a lot of specials, all of which sounded amazing.  My rabbit leg was delicious and the caramel tart for dessert was out of this world- it was so creamy and the caramel flavor was absolutely perfect.  Highly recommend.

I literally laughed and disgusted at the same time reading your comment below. Mind you when you and I dined in  (yes, you read that right) yesterday, it was  Columbus Day. The restaurant was so packed and they were short of staff. (I sat at a table a few feet away from you.) Yes, I agree at times the owner could come across as feisty and annoyed. I can attest that her reactions towards the patrons were not based on one's race or ethnicity but towards their rudeness and low mannerisms and behaviors. Have you witnessed and seen some of the requests many of them have asked on that day? \n\nThis is a restaurant business that caters mostly to Indonesians. The fact that you brought racial discrimination disgust me. As a fellow Indonesian, you need to know that racial discrimination and racial segregation are two sensitive subjects that should be brought up carefully among and with your fellow Indonesians because those touchy subjects can bring back the awful memories of the tragedy of 1998 that many of us had carried and wish to never happen again, ever. Perhaps you need to ask your parents about the root cause of the 1998 Riot that happened in Jakarta and also in many big cities in Indonesia. Many of us have left our beloved country so that we could be safe.  Many of us have sacrificed being away from family and children for so long to only start from scratch in America, the land of opportunity -- as long one is willing to work hard and sacrifice A LOT to achieve his or her goals. You should feel fortunate to be having the opportunity to live your life freely in a country where diversity is valued, and good moral is acknowledged.  So next time, before you leave a very obtrusive feedback, please be factual.\n\nOh, I hope you are reading this, Melissa.",3,KrqfLGL8FiJvJwPSTAsN-w

I live right around the corner from Federal Donuts and while their products are A+, 100%, top shelf donuts - chicken - coffee, THE SERVICE IS AWFUL!!!!! It's like if Verizon, AT&T, and Comcast decided to make donuts and wanted to treat customers even more like schmucks than they already do.but it's not that they're being jerks...it's that they are totally and utterly incompetent.  \n\nThey pack you into this sardine can they call a shop and sort you out by a numbers system which really means 30 people are stuffed into a 15 person room with hot coffee in their hands and bumping into one another. Not to mention the time you're waiting is always way too long. It's like a good 15 minutes of standing there waiting before ordering and then who knows how long after that. \n\nTHEY RUN OUT all the time. If anything they think it's awesome to ""SELL OUT"". How about not selling out...how about actually providing the products you sell? CRAZY RIGHT?!?!?  Not to mention the hours are total crap...so not only do they run out of food but they close early. They can't even keep the amount of food for the small amount of hours they're open. Figure out how much you sell and supply it.\n\n""Can I get a chocolate covered banana donut?""\n""No, we ran out. Actually we only have  Oatmeal raisin and S'mores""\n""There's six types of donuts on the menu and you only have two? It's only 11:50am!!""\n\nAnd forget about chicken. It's awesome, which is even more frustrating because you better be ready to schedule your entire morning around it. Everyone waits and waits and waits while trays upon trays of chicken sit behind the counter. They only have one line/cashier so they call a number for chicken then see if anyone just wants donuts....\nwhy not try two cashiers/lines?\nwhy not take orders over the phone so people can just pick it up?\nwhy not actually have enough product on site or another site to go to when you run out?\nwhy not treat people with respect and courtesy? \nMaybe these aren't the solutions but try SOMETHING!\n\nI was actually told that they ran out of ""fancy"" donuts...so I ordered a two hot ones and then a worker walks up to the cashier and told him to stop taking orders. STOP TAKING ORDERS? You're a donut shop with 20 people inside and you're not taking donut orders? I left and didn't go back for a good two months. I wanted to give it another go and AGAIN, they ran out of fancy donuts and the numbers for the chicken were in the high twenties with low numbers being called. So forget about chicken if you have anything else planned. It's never been so hard to get a business's product. \n\nFederal Donuts needs to pay less attention to they're sarcastic facebook posts and more on treating customers with respect. They're not rude locals slinging cheesesteaks with an attitude justified from years of dealing with obnoxious city folk, they're little hipster kids that should be grateful for the business. What happened to the days when businesses actually appreciated their customers?\n\nI gave them one star because no matter how good their food is, it's not even close to the effort that needs to be put in and I live around the corner.\n\nFederal Donuts....PLEASE STOP MAKING IT SO HARD TO BUY YOUR FOOD!

The hot chicken was hot - end of story.  The food went from good and flavorable to know taste at all. The dessert, zucchini bread, was ok.\nDont think i will be rushing back.

Banana Cream Pie and Sticky Bun that are currently in rotation could practically stand in for their namesakes.  \n\nBut 9 mornings out of 10 I'm walking out with a half dozen hot donuts, three plain (or old fashioned), three assorted of the sugar offerings and a small hot coffee.  Some like it hot, and also for the paper bag that carried the donuts home to be translucent leaning transparent as it sucked up some fry oil.  That isn't to say they're oily or greasy.

Not me.  So we head up to Fairmont Ave in search of some food.  We come across London Grill which looks very interesting with its Fluorescent pink neon on the side of the building.  We walk in the FRONT door.  The place is clean, there are a few Phillies fans sitting at the bar enjoying the game.  The atmosphere is very laid back.  We seat ourselves.  The waiter is extremely attentive and has a great personality.  We scope out the menu and my stomach is screaming ""BURGER"" ""BURGER"" so I check out the London burger and it comes on an English muffin?? So I think to myself, English muffin.... I don't want nooks and crannies touching my beef.  I ask the waiter if he can replace the muffin with a normal all American hamburger bun and he politely informs me that he can accommodate.  Maria orders the scallops and some cheesy thing.  As we're waiting for our food the Phillies are getting absolutely crushed... Cole has let up several home runs and yet again the Phillies can't mount an offense.  The food comes out and the burger looks amazing, Maria's food looks great too.  They have the old school ketchup bottles which I think is super cool... so I karate chop the bottle a dozen times and out comes the ketchup.  The food was great.  As we leave out of the FRONT door we hear some patrons sitting nearby say ""I've never seen anyone leave out of THAT door"" almost mocking my girlfriend and I for leaving out of the FRONT door.  I turn around and see that on the FRONT door there is an arrow pointing around to the SIDE of the establishment claiming that the SIDE door is the FRONT door.  This door situation has me scratching my head... So the true FRONT door is directing me to go to the SIDE door that they claim is the FRONT door.  Why do they even have the FRONT door?  And why are my girlfriend and I being crucified by locals for leaving out of the correct door?

I probably grab lunch or dinner at Cosi once or twice a week, as it's super convenient for me, and I have my favorite menu items I rotate. However, today I got sucked in by the new featured sandwich - Lobster Salad. DO NOT GET THE LOBSTER SALAD SANDWICH! \n\nThere was nothing right with this sandwich. It was probably 70% of what I will call ""mystery white sauce"". I couldn't really pick out exactly what the sauce was. There was definitely cream cheese, bc that's all that was in my first 3 bites, but there was something else mixed with it which somehow managed to make the mystery white sauce both chunky and runny at the same time. Yummy, right?\n\nWhat was in that final 30%?  20% bread, 5% lettuce, 5% lobster.  The lobster was chewy and flavorless. It reminded me of artificial crab sticks.  They were out of wheat bread, so I wasn't happy about that, but I made the choice not to wait til the wheat was done baking, so I can't complain. I guess the bread and lettuce were okay.  \n\nIn conclusion, if you want to eat a piece of bread filled with about 2 inches of cream cheese/mystery white sauce with the occasional added texture of flavorless lobster and chopped romaine lettuce, have at it.  But I'm pretty sure you could make that for yourself for less than $8.99 + tax. \n\nIf you're not burned out on turkey, and they still have it, I recommend the turkey stuffing sandwich.

They also gave us sourdough bread and tahini sauce to dip which was also tasty. \n\nFor mains: minced lamb kabobs, red drum, and the goat chop. The goat chop was just 1 chop when 2 or 3 is more standard which was the only negative. Similarly, given the price point, two small kabobs seemed a bit insubstantial for the minced dish. The food itself, however, was wonderful and I especially loved the bulgar mash that came with the kabobs. Really fantastic. The goat chop was also supposed to be very, very good, but the dolmas and stuffed zuchinni was just alright.

You're going to get stuffed, just don't let the pita do that job. \n-Bring a lose belt, if you don't have one, don't bring one at all. \n-Don't bring anyone who has innately ""dirty hands"" \n-Come VERY hungry to leave VERY satisfied \n-Apart from the reviews of people complaining that it's a BYOB even though they have a full bar, I've brought wine every time and they happily open it but can bring you drinks from their stash as well - they are very friendly. \n-If you're not accustomed to foreign food, be open minded, it's all delicious. \n-Bring cash! Also, most groups are large so check the bill because tip is probably added. \n-Knock on the front door! It's at the corner of intersecting side streets (Gaskill and Leithgow). Since it's just off of South st I'm sure they lock the door to keep the trash out. \n\nOkay, so first, anyone who comes to the city to visit me generally gets a trip here. Why? Because I've never had a bad experience. The service is always culturally reserved yet friendly. The food is always outstanding. For the chicken I always recommend the spicy. if you have a mixed group (some don't like spicy) you can get the olive base and ask for a side of spicy sauce. For the choice of kabobs or lamb, they are both excellent, just pick your kill. The bastilla (the 2nd dish pound of pastry). It is is my favorite and always super hot so break it apart before diving in to the devilishly delicious blend. \n\nI've had a date here and really enjoyed it and I've had a birthday party with over 20 people and the experience was just as awesome. During my birthday, we probably brought 15 bottles of wine (no comments please...) and the waiters kept coming over to make sure we had plenty of water and kept uncorking for us. We brought one young baby who slept most of the time but she started crying (though briefly) and the owner offered to take her for a moment because mom was eating and he actually rocked her! She stopped crying and he gave her back to mom. He absolutely DIDN'T have to do that, but they are just that friendly there. (It helps I go often, so he recognizes us). Another member of our party mentioned she is allergic to nuts, so they actually baked her a mini bastilla without nuts, yet another nice touch. \n\nThe ambiance of this place is great, it's 3 stories of segregated dens, some larger than others. I do recommend getting reservations, especially on weekends because they only have a few seatings a night - remember you're there for all those courses. I've seen many times where they've had to turn people away and told them they were booked for the night.

The view from one of the window tables was spectacular. I ordered a magarita (with salt) to start off the night. It was good, but nothing was particularly special about it. We ordered the lobster macaroni & cheese and the crispy risotto to share for our appetizers. The lobster macaroni & cheese is to die for. It was so delicious. The crispy risotto was good, but the lobster macaroni & cheese was definitely my favorite. For our entrees, we ordered the chicken ""picnic"" and the salmon frites. I had the salmon frites and it was good. The salmon was cooked perfectly. The fries that accompanied it were so crispy and crunchy. The meal was overall perfect. With that said, I did feel as though the menu was lacking due to limited options.  As for the service, my server was very friendly and really nice. At the end of our meal, she snuck up behind me after we asked for the check to serve me a little cake with a candle in it. I was really touched by her efforts to make sure I was surprised. The service that she provided was amazing. She checked up on us multiple times to make sure everything was okay, but she didn't intrude upon our dinner in any way. I give R2L five stars mainly for the atmosphere, the view and the service. Although the food was delicious, I believe that I could get food that is just as delicious for cheaper.

Do I love Dominican food this much that I'm willing to be annoyed by it?**\n__\nAttempt #1 - Look what I found!\n__\nEverything was cool order was right on time, portions were really nice. I had oxtail and canoas. Finally able to find decent canoas in Philly near Center City. Plus points for getting here in less than 20 minutes\n\n__\nAttempt #2 -Curious\n__\nI REALLY want to like this place, but the little things make all the difference. We stopped in to grab food the staff is super sweet and kind, but the portion when you order to go/delivery was WAY(live visibly) smaller then when you eat in. I've ordered the same 3 things here over the course of finding this place.\n\nI'm not sure if different staffing effects portioning but this is weird.\n__\nAttempt #3 - It's getting worse \n__\n\nThis is a SUPER unfortunate situation, as I REALLY like this place..\n\nI ordered from Parada today. Normally everything is super on point and I get stuff pretty quickly...However today was no good. My initial order was not on time, and it was stated it was delayed by 15 minutes.... It was then 15 minutes after the 2nd estimated time. (so over 30 additional minutes late)\n\nI was like ok it's cool I like this place a lot, so it's cool I then opened my food (Cubano, Pasteles, and pinto beans) and everything was cold... not like cold from the delivery like everything was CLEARLY sitting.\n\nSo I called... and spoke with a nice young lady who informed me that the delivery guy was out when my order came in and by the time he arrived my sandwich ""had already been sitting like 15 minutes, and then the delivery time""... Not sure why a fresh one wouldn't be made... you wouldn't feed that to an in house guest..  I was told to call tomorrow and they would resend it (cause at this point I don't have time to wait.)\n\nI know you're saying well you could warm it up... NOBODY warms up pasteles or a cubano...  it's meant to be enjoyed as fresh as possible.\n\n__\nAttempt # 4 - Eat24 had to ""track down"" this order\n__\nOld rice, and inconsistent portion.. I went from discovering this place and loving it to now being one of my least favorite places to eat or deal with.\n\nNot only did it take an hour and 15 minutes to get a dish described as (a la carte) but when it arrived the delivery driver was rude, didn't thank me for his tip (which I regret giving), the rice I received was old (or under cooked), and the portion was way smaller than it was when I order just a week prior.\n\nI really REALLY wanted to love this place, but consistent disappointment has turned a great experience to trash. The staff was extremely unhelpful previously and I'm not sure I want to reach out this time as I was literally told ""call tomorrow maybe the manager can help you.""\n\nI guess you need to eat in house to get the proper experience....\n\nEAT24 was amazing with helping me find the order initially, and deal with my issue post delivery... so that's a plus",2,yLRgfnhZZfNp7KASyRL6ZQ

My friend and I had made the decision to go here over a few other popular restaurants because we liked what was on the menu that was posted on the restaurant week page. When we got to the restaurant, however, the options that were available on the menu in front of us were considerably different than what the restaurant had provided on the menu of the restaurant week website. \n\nI chose deviled eggs as my first course, which I must say were absolutely delicious. The only issue was that the serving was 2 halves of a single hard-boiled egg, which definitely left me wanting more. My friend chose the charred shishito peppers and avocado, which quite literally was a large bowl of shishito peppers and chopped avocado. We were not impressed by the disproportionate appetizer sizes and the fact that my friend's appetizer seemed haphazardly thrown together, as she was expected to eat a bowl of whole peppers and chunks of avocado with no bread/chips/anything else that one would normally eat this type of food on. I don't know about anyone else, but picking up flavorless pieces of avocado with a fork just doesn't seem appealing to me.\n\nMy main meal was the bucatini, which was supposed to come with mushrooms, smoked fennel, and a carbonara sauce. It was almost impossible to taste anything over the artificial smokey flavor that completely overpowered the dish. Additionally, they totally covered the dish in rosemary leaves, which felt like I was literally eating mouthfuls of pine needles. Again, not impressed.\n\nFor dessert, I had the panna cotta, which was good but was overpowered by a rosemary flavor (?). I mean throwing some vanilla bean or espresso in there would have made sense, but rosemary?! There was no flavor that tied it together, so it tasted like sweet rosemary jello. No good.\n\nOverall, the place itself was very cute and had a nice ambiance. Service was good as well. The food just didn't seem good enough to come back, especially at the steep steep steep prices that these dishes normally go for. If I had paid one cent more for this meal, I would have been very angry. There's better restaurants out there for the price.",0,rsEHIwMEclzTnhI3Cv22BA

A word of advice: be early if not punctual if coming for happy hour. The staff here is very strict about this. One minute late, and they don't give you the discount for drinks. They also stop giving out happy hour priced food menus to customers before happy hour finishes because the customer is too last-minute and is closer to regular dinner hours than happy hour. As my group and I got to R2L at 6:20 PM, we were given the regular dinner menu. \n\nThe food was very good, if a bit pricey. We split a steak tartare which had small pieces of filet mignon seasoned with dijon sauce and topped with root vegetables. This came with crispy pieces of garlic and butter flatbread which was used to scoop up the raw meat. This was my first time eating steak tartare, and I rather enjoyed the delicacy and richness of the steak. The meat is well seasoned, the root vegetables give some fresh tartness, and the bread pairs perfectly with both together.\n\nWhile the food was good, the real reason to come here is for the gorgeous view.

The fried chicken was out-of-control. We opted to get one dry and one glazed order. Our dry order was the buttermilk ranch, which had a great balance of flavor, I was worried it would be too 'ranchy', that wasn't the case, it was a perfect ratio of buttermilk batter to ranch seasoning. The real flavor was the chile-garlic. This has to be my favorite glaze of absolutely anything that has been in my mouth, whether it be ribs, a burger, a friggin salad or even calamari, this glaze would be perfect on almost anything. The spice-to-sweetness ratio was near perfect, a little on the spicy side, so, if you're sensitive don't get it. \n\nI'm going to stop writing now because it's making me too damn hungry. Oh yeah, they sell out really fast so get there ASAP. \n\nFYI, they will be opening a new spot in center city soon.

Looking at the menu and reading the review, I was ready to give it a try. It's just... the execution of their ideas fell short. \n\nWe tried the Korean tacos and the kimchi poutine. I think the ideas were great for both dishes. But the bulgogi in taco was dry and overcooked, perhaps because the cut was too thick and had too high of a meat-to-veggie ratio. Based on what I grew up eating, bulgogi is supposed to be thinly sliced, tender, juicy, and have all flavor marinated from onion and pear. Their green sauce thing was also a bit off. \n\nKimchi in the kimchi poutine was surprisingly good. The combination of kimchi, egg, and cheese is hard to fail when your kimchi itself made well and cooked perfectly. Kudos to Southgate for that part. I think the idea of kimchi poutine is interesting and has a potential work, but their fries were way too oily.\n\nI think both dishes might work if you walk into this place expecting a greasy bar food with Korean influence. I don't know what the culinary training background of the chef here is, but his/her ideas are great, just needs a better execution. I really want this place to do well and get better.\n\nTheir service was amazing by the way - our server was David according to the receipt, who was extremely attentive (he must have poured water for us 17 times) and made thoughtful recommendations.\n\nDrink selection isn't long but decent.

The overall ambience was elevated with a piano playing in the background.  As part of the New Year celebration, the restaurant handed out hats and noisemakers and had a few Mummers serenade the tables right before midnight.

The place was mostly empty, so we chose a table up front near the bar to take in the sunlight streaming in through the large windows.  At first, there seemed to be no problems; the server was friendly, took our order, brought our drinks, and even provided a little plate of some sort of pastries and fresh fruit.  An hour later, however, it became painfully evident there was a big problem because we still didn't have the food we'd ordered (a breakfast burrito and a kale salad).  The server told us on three separate occasions that our meals would be out shortly, but those occasions were unfortunately 15-20 minutes apart.  She apologized for the wait when she brought our check, but no effort was made to offer any discount or other incentive to return.\n\nWe theorize that the chef may not yet have arrived at work when we came in for brunch around 10:30; it's difficult to think of any other explanation for the prolonged wait, and when we got our food, it clearly had been prepared only minutes before.  (Incidentally, the food was okay, but it wasn't noteworthy in any way -- and certainly not worth waiting an hour for.)  It remains up for debate whether the little pastries-and-fruit offering was meant to distract us from the hour-long wait London Grill knew full well we might have.  I understand that sometimes unexpected issues arise and the kitchen can't open on time (supposedly 10:00 on Saturdays), but if that was the case, then London Grill should have informed us upfront that the kitchen wasn't yet open that day.\n\nI might not have been so annoyed if we didn't have other plans that afternoon that made time an issue.  As it were, however, I ended up rushing around far more than I would've liked to, and I still regret that I didn't choose one of the other two Fairmount spots we'd considered trying that morning.  I'd advise against making the same mistake I did.",2,bUyZ3DN2nKPhZNjtTnWMlA

I went just for the donuts, but was told they only had one kind of donut, and it only came with fried chicken. I said why not, and tried both. They had six different varieties of chicken: chili garlic, sweet ginger, buttermilk, coconut curry, and an arab seasoning. I went with the chili garlic, which was delightfully, but not painfully, spicy. The chicken was crispy on the outside, soft and juicy on the inside, and incredibly flavorful. The girl who helped me was incredibly bright, friendly, and chatted with me the entire time I was there. The donuts were sweet, doughy, soft, and warm. I didn't even come for chicken, but I was very pleasantly surprised by a delicious meal. There isn't room to eat inside, though, so get ready to go.",1,T9aisv9FFuEbO9hSgi-efw

I had heard so many good things about the restaurant and had been dying to go!!\n\nNot sure if it's everyday thing but when we arrived at the door was locked and we had to knock to be let in. When you walk in you'll see bunch of round couch settings with about 6 round tables. We sat at the table closest to the front entrance which turned out to be really nice since it was very cold that day so we were all so bundled up but the restaurant itself was cozy. The cold breeze coming in when the hostess let guests in felt nice. You definitely need at least 4 people in a party to attempt to eat.\n\nWhen we sat down we were given a bunch of towels to put in everyone's laps. I think it's to wipe your hands after the nice rise water hand wash. Perhaps also to catch foods for noobs like me.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Shiraz which it said was $26 on the menu but when the bill came it rung up to less(I think $16). Maybe it was a house wine? Not sure. I saw a bunch of other groups bringing their own bottles so I suppose you can byob as well but the website does say $3 per person for uncorking. \n\nFood was mostly amazing. You get a 7 big portion course meal for 25 bucks. Can't beat that. My favorites were the veggie appetizer platter (carrots, eggplants andcucumbers), chicken and couscous dishes. Chicken is so soft and juicy. Couscous is perfectly cooked and the dish has a good nutty flavor. The veggie appetizer platter is a good starter as it is light (not small portion by any means) and refreshing. \n\nSomething I really liked about all of the dishes were that they were not so salty. Lamb and beef had good flavor but not overly salty. The chicken had a lot of spices and herbs on the surfaces but was not salty. One dish I was not a huge fan of was the almond chicken pie. It was a bit weird and I was confused because it has chicken in it so it taste like it could be a meal but it's also sweet because the pastry around the chicken is almond powder and sweet. I really liked their baklava. I don't have much experiences with baklava but other ones I have had were overly sweet but the ones from here not overly sweet but had good nutty and good consistency. By no means that I am a Moroccan food expert but everything here was good.\n\nThe servers are great also. They do not smile much but kind. My father cannot eat red meat and we had just mentioned it without requesting for any accommodation when we were ordering at the beginning. When the lamb and beef came out they had brought out a spinach pie for him. The servers would also ask if you want any of the food packed to go after each course which we said yes to some (you will have leftovers).The hostess emphasized that they have been in business for a really long time (40 some years he said I think?) which shows pride. \n\nWill go back 100%!",2,nm6rVuEUUjaxjC5K0bvlWg

The pictures and description of this place in Bridge and Tunnel monthly - I mean Philadelphia magazine - gave my stomach an erection, which I didn't even think was physiologically possible. My lust for Pub & Kitchen motivated me to give the place shot on an otherwise Typically Unremarkable Weeknight. \n\nUpon arriving, I waited a few minutes before being led by my server through an increasingly dark, cacophonous, narrow corridor made out of drunk people until I finally reached the eating area at the back of P&K. Why pubs subject patron and server alike to the natural consequences of thickheaded layout is beyond me. \n\nI started off with wings (the sweet variant), followed by a pulled pork sandwich and fries. Quite frankly, the wings were embarrassing. Every last one was overcooked to the point of crunchiness. ""Off night, maybe"", I thought to myself as I tried to avoid chipping my teeth on what undoubtedly was tender chicken meat prior to crossing the path of the wrong disgruntled P&K line chef. The sauce itself was good, but lipstick/pig. \n\nSpeaking of pig, the pulled pork sandwich was strictly average. I couldn't taste much of the meat trapped under the accompanying sauce avalanche, but that wouldn't have even bothered me much if the sauce itself was great. Unfortunately, it wasn't - you could find better at Pathmark. All I'll say about the fries is that I didn't even like them enough to take home with me post-meal. \n\nThe servers got the bare minimum done and not much more. They were aloof, largely absent, and quicker to ask me to move over one spot mid-meal than to refill my water. \n\nMaybe my stomach needs Viagra. Maybe this was all a case of me ordering the wrong thing and maybe my experience really wasn't representative of what P&K is capable of. Maybe I'd rather try dozens of other restaurants than risk finding out if I'm right.",3,DcqwrZ2IOAXb4LvE6TLDWQ

For the second course, we ordered the Acadian Redfish Filet and butcher's filet. Both of them were amazing and cooked perfectly. For the third course, we got the dark chocolate tart and cookies & cream parfait.

Eating with your hands and having great conversation in an intimate setting of a dimly lit room with fabric all over the place is just cool.\n\nThe food has been consistently good and it is the same choices and courses over time.  The vegetable platter of eggplant, cucumbers/tomatoes, and carrots has to be my absolute favorite.  The pastry filled with chicken is savory and sweet with the powdered sugar on top.  Watch your fingers for the temperature burn!  The chicken is better than a rotisserie chicken, and you can get spicy or not.  They will bring the spice on the side for you if desired, and it's nice to dip if you like the spice!  Then, lamb  (meat on a plate with honey and almonds) or beef kebabs, or you can get a 1/2 and 1/2 if you want.  We did, and the lamb is always tender and the beef kebab filling.  Couscous with fresh fruit is kind of bland, and then there is hot mint tea which is a nice sugar rush, and baklava which I always skip because I'm usually too full, and I'm just not a fan of it.\n\nMarrakesh is a BYOB, and we have actually brought and killed multiple bottles of Moroccan wine - Ouled Thaleb ($17 at the State Stores) which is a blended red which goes well throughout the meal.  No corkage charges and they'll get rid of your empty bottles!  I think our group of eight killed at least eight bottles.\n\nAbout every 45 minutes, when the music gets turned up and pretty much too loud, you get to be dazzled by the belly dancer making her way throughout the restaurant.  You know she's getting close when the ting-ting-ting of her finger cymbals are getting loud.  Maybe you'll get to dance with her, or convince your drunk friend to.  It's amusing to watch.  \n\nMarrakesh's service is mostly spot-on as they have been doing this for a long time.  But, sometimes it can be slow.  The pita bread can be cold and a bit stale.

I will never set foot in one of your establishments again, rude before coffee never works for me.

I'd seen the episode of Bizarre Foods even before I'd even moved to Philadelphia, so this had been on my to-eat list for a while. Unfortunately, when walking down the Italian Market, I'd usually already stuffed myself by the time we'd gotten to George's. Well, not this time. We decided to get the TNT (tongue and tripe) and the spicy veal. The dude working the counter recommended long hots and onions on both, so we told him to layer it on.\n\nAdmittedly, these sandwiches are likely meant to be eaten as soon as they're prepped. I mean, the fillings are soaked in vats of stew for god knows how many hours (which probably contributes to their soft, soaked-in goodness!) and the roll is soft and absorbent--can't describe this bad boy as crusty. But, against our own better judgment, we did takeout and waited til getting home to slay these beasts. If you decide to go this route, you're gonna want a plate underneath and maybe some rubber gloves. ""Soggy"" is an understatement, but it doesn't stop the sandwiches from being little bundles of joy. The tongue and tripe stew seemed peppery and was my favorite of the two. The veal wasn't spicy at all, but was still delicious, and had a texture similar to pulled pork. If I grabbed another one of George's sandwiches, I'd definitely eat it on site.",6,phoMcYUbBJeAKUD0GE76GA

If you're here for the view, you're going to be paying a hefty check. This restaurant is located at the top of a high-rise building, but to sit at a window, a special request must be made beforehand with a guarantee of a large sum. \n\nThe menu here is severely overpriced, especially given the quality of the food. We started off with the short ribs with nachos, and they were sub-par. Any classic Mexican restaurant in Texas would've killed the nachos, but I guess this is what happens when you overvalue the ambiance and order nachos at a high-end restaurant. I ordered the medium-well, 22 oz rib eye. I'm a big meat fan, and I was disappointed to find that part of my rib eye was flat out raw. When cooking such a large piece of meat, I can kind of understand if it's raw when ordering medium rare, but I ordered my meat practically all the way cooked. It goes to show that some of the chefs aren't as careful or just simply don't care. The dessert was at least good, and it made up just a tiny bit for the mishap.\n\nOverall, this restaurant is not worth it. If you were to get a middle seat at R2L, you wouldn't be able to enjoy the spectacular view. The food isn't good, so you'll end up having a mediocre food with a mediocre meal.

We placed a deposit of $1,200 in October to reserve the date.  In January following the holidays we made reservations to eat dinner there and to get in the mood for the final lead up to the wedding.  I received a hasty voicemail only hours before our reservation stating that they couldn't honor our reservation because the restaurant is temporarily closed, and, as an aside, as they reopen we would be the first phone call they make regarding our buyout.  Naturally with the wedding only a few months away, we began to investigate alternatives and requested our deposit back.  That voicemail was the last I heard from them despite several emails and attempts to get my deposit back.  The space is up for rent - and still no communication or apology from Kanella.  It was only through filing a dispute with my credit card company that I finally received my deposit back.  They never even offered to transfer our buyout to their other location.  (That wouldn't have worked for our guest count, but they had an opportunity to try to keep their money.)  I have seen from Open Table that other guests have shown up for reservations that were made after the restaurant closed.  I firmly believe that had we not had the buyout arranged we would not have even received the aforementioned phone call.  Needless to say, we will never patronize Kanella Grill again, and I would especially caution anyone considering doing a larger group event there (we've seen a number of rehearsal dinners and other special occasions).",0,Na2TfO_aP3yDcvhdmU7Z-w

As proponents of the paleo lifestyle we're always looking for restaurants capable of accommodating our high standards. I was hoping Supper would be a go-to but I was somewhat let down overall.\n I'll start with the good. \nThe place has good feng shui. It's a pleasing dining room with rustic yet artsy decor, and an upstairs I didn't even know about.\nA member of our party was running late so three of us sat at the bar. The bartender was sweet and lovely and professional. She guided our drink selections and also chimed into conversation which I always welcome. The positive service experience ended there.\n We were seated by the hostess and the server followed to get a drink order. I don't recall an introduction, because I don't remember his name, but I do recall that he never smiled once or offered even the mildest of pleasantries. He just seemed pissy. He took the drink menu away after the first drink was ordered and then pulled the wine glasses immediately. Perhaps that's standard policy, but we were all drinking alcohol and 2 of us brought wine from the bar, so....seemed premature to me. Especially since we immediately asked for the wine list and ordered more wine. There were at least 2 occasions where I tried to ask him a question that he apparently couldn't hear (aghem, I've never been accused of being a low talker...) so rather than walk around the table to hear me better I ended up shouting at him. I was fully annoyed with him after All this and probably didn't hide it after 3 glasses of wine. He became somewhat less surly, but everything about his attitude came close to ruining the whole dinner for me. Thank god we were with friends having good conversation.\n\n It didn't help the experience for us that we were the last table left in the restaurant. We weren't seated until after 8:30 and I suppose it was around 10:15 when we realized the room was cleared out and the servers were mopping and convening at the bar waiting for us to wrap it up. We may have stayed for another drink but we felt like ""those"" people that servers hate and felt pretty uncomfortable. So we left!\n\nAs for the food, we ordered deviled eggs, the masa tamale fries, and duck fat fries for appetizers. For me, that was the culinary highlight. The eggs were inventive and delicious as everyone says and I could easily live off those for the rest of my days. The masa fries were a refreshing change of pace and flavor. The duck fat fries were tasty buy cut a little thick for my taste.\nThe carrot squash soup with candied ginger was not without flavor but it was really just ok. I've had much better in that category.\nMy husband and I both order the pan seared striped bass, unusual for us to order the same thing, and so did our friend. It was served over greens and fennel purée. The fish was cooked and plated perfectly but it just didn't taste like anything at all. Too bland even for bass.\nTaking all things into account it was just a 3 star experience. I'm willing to give it another try When the menu changes, but if that aging blonde server who either hates his job or hates people is even in the restaurant, I'll probably turn around and walk out.\n\nI'm so fascinated by this lack of social grace and appropriate service in a highly rated restaurant, or even any restaurant for that matter. I'm guessing the poor behavior is reinforced as patrons continue to tip well out of social pressure rather than insuring prompt service, as tipping was intended to promote..patrons like my friend and husband who split the bill in half and still tipped this guy 20%.\n\nAll I can say is I'm very vocal about this because it bothers me so much, but many people may not be and simply don't return to a place that made them feel uncomfortable. I dine out for the experience. If one server sours the experience, I will remember that more than the food even if it was good.",0,trv2a6m_O8_83ay2-CgoEQ

And we checked in on Yelp to get some free calamari, too!\n\nThe food was good. My boyfriend ordered the lobster bisque, filet mignon, and creme brulee. The presentation of the bisque was pretty funny -- they bring you out a bowl that has several chunks of lobster in it and a saucer containing the soup that they pour into the bowl, just to make sure you know that there's real lobster chunks in it. The bisque was very tasty, and I gladly helped my boyfriend finish it. He really liked his steak and veggies (I didn't try it because I don't eat beef). And the creme brulee was delicious. The fresh raspberries on top were a nice touch. My dish was just ok. I don't mean to complain about my free entree, but the fact is if you go for dinner, there are only 2-3 entrees that are $25 that you can use the coupon for. I chose the pretzel covered trout. It was just a little too oily for my liking, and the pretzel coating also made the dish a little too salty. It at least came with asparagus to make it somewhat healthy. Anyway, the serving was huge, and I took home enough food for lunch the next day.

This place has been around since 1930. And while it started as pork place the line for the ""steaks"" is 10 times as long as the line for pork.  Keep it simple and get the classic cheesesteak with American cheese and grilled onions.  They are huge so either don't order any sides or split a steak and try the really good fries or rings.

I love Taleggio cheese, and I guess the promise of the fig lead me to believe that it would be jammy and luscious and figgy-ness everywhere. Not the case. (I'm sure they weren't) but the figs had the same quality as slightly underripe raw figs; it gave more of a texture rather than a flavor to the flatbread. The wilted arugula it was presented on helped when heaped on top to give some sort of flavor. But, on to dinner!\nGot the cioppino; so much seafood, so delicious. What threw me was the pasta with the dish. It might be because I'm used to cioppinos coming in just a broth, like a bouillabaisse, but it just didn't need the pasta. Plus it was angel hair. I feel like even Mr. Batali would have an issue with cooking angel hair pasta. Duck confit looked great though, didn't try any, but did sample the poached pear, and it was wine-soaked and awesome. \nDid get the brussel sprouts with CRANBERRIES!? Genius. So so delicious.

When he was finished with that transaction, he gave me the bag and began to ring me up - I had to remind him that I ordered a coffee too.  He got my coffee (and split the lid on the coffee cup, did not replace it, which cased some coffee to slosh out and onto my hand as I walked to my office -OUCH), rang me up, took my money and made my change.  But before handing it back to me, walked over to another customer who apparently had an issue with a hot take-out item.  He actually stood there, with my change in his hand, talking to the other customer and a server (about 15 feet away).  After he dealt with that issue he walked back and handed me my change.   Seriously, as a former server, this dude needs to learn how to multi-task and to prioritize.  It took about 5 minutes to get my breakfast - way to long to put a muffin in a bag, pour a cup of coffee and ring someone up.\nAs a side note - aside from myself and the woman who was waiting for her hot breakfast we were the only people at the take-out area - it was later in the morning so it was not busy at all.  \n\nSorry this was more of a rant than a review, but this dude is terrible at customer service - the female manager is awesome though.\n\nAside from that their prices are pretty good and the food is consistent - not spectacular but always tasty.

The bartender on most nights, Kyle, makes an excellent cocktail.  He recently saved some young ladies from being trampled in first-day-of-Spring ""flash riot,"" as detailed in a Daily News article.  Kyle is a great guy, and a good reason why you should visit Supper.\n\nThe food at Supper is also quite good.  I especially like the burger and their smoked chicken wings.  I've had various other starters here.  The ""eggs of the day"" is an interesting choice.  Supper is also a nice spot for Sunday brunch.  For my part I have had their Eggs Benedict and the frittata, which were both good.  They do an all-you-can-eat cereal offering with all your childhood favorites in case you are ten, or in college, or just into that sort of thing.  The French press coffee is a nice extra, last time I had brunch I left on a rocket ship after drinking way too much of it.\n\nThe interior of Supper has a warm feel.  The bar is modern and classy with most folks sipping cocktails.  They formerly served a spicy popcorn as a free bar snack - not sure what happened to that.  Supper is easy on the eyes.  Lots of wood, exposed beams and industrial pipes, it's just cool.  The silverware and other-metal-junk modern art chandelier really brings it all together.  You'll know when you see it.\n\nMy biggest gripe with Supper is the prices.  $11 dollars for any of their brunch drink offerings is downright oppressive, and for that reason I'll go elsewhere for bunch.  The beers and cocktails (while good) are Old City expensive, and the beer only comes in bottles.  But the pricey menu does not seem to hurt their business very much.  Each time I visit they are busy, both in the dining space and at the bar.  They also have a large upstairs dining area but this is mostly reserved for private parties, and to my knowledge not used on most nights.  \n\nIf the neighborhood folks want to pay these prices that's great, I like the place too, and the staff is very friendly (Kyle in particular), so please continue to support Supper.

This is the tale...you'll have to use your imagination because again I took no pictures. It is hard to remember when you get caught up in the menu selections. This place is so fun to eat at. I love seafood and the menu items here are so exciting! Does it sound crazy to be excited by fish?\n\nWell I don't care! I love to cook, but fish at home doesn't always work out for me. Lots of restaurants don't do fish well. So I don't order it enough. Here they have more than you can order. \n\nGrab a glass of wine or a martini and take your time reviewing the menu. And if you have questions your server will be well versed and be able to answer a variety of questions and make recommendations. \n\nStarters include tuna poke, ceviche, signature crab cakes, salmon carpaccio, calamari, littleneck clams. I had the crab cakes sharing with my dining partner. I was torn between the poke & ceviche as well.\n\nDinner includes roughly 6-7 fresh catches like trout, cod, tuna, and 3-4 other unique fish. There are fried shrimp, salmon dishes, swordfish, lobster, aged steaks and great sides. Sides tonight were lobster Mac and cheese, risotto, potatoes, asparagus, more...\n\nI had the potato crusted cod with the asparagus side. Nicely prepared with a perfect portion; so that you don't leave uncomfortable.  And for dessert a killer giant piece of carrot cake-also shared. Don't walk by.

I had been wanting to try this place for a while, and finally had the opportunity to do so for brunch today.  It should have been a red flag when we walked in at 1:30pm on a Sunday, and there were tons of tables available. But the hostess was sweet and the decor pleasing, so I remained optimistic.  \n\nWe sat down and reviewed the menu.  Up in the top right corner was a little box listing all of the wonderful fresh vegetables they were using from a local farm.  This inspired me to order the ""BE Farm Greens and Herbs Salad with apple, bacon, cornbread and buttermilk dressing"" listed under ""Lunch Stuff.""  I thought, sounds a little rich, but it's brunch, I'll splurge on the calories.  I asked the server several questions about the salad.  She said that it was greens, cinnamon apples, smoked bacon and cornbread hushpuppies.  This sounded amazing.  I ordered a side of ""Crispy Apple Beignets w/ cinnamon and sugar,"" thinking, oh I will share this with the table.  \n\nUm, ok, the food arrived.  I have never been so underwhelmed in my life.  The salad was a small handful of greens, one apple slice, and a sprinkling of tiny bacon pieces.  If there was cornbread, hushpuppies, or any combination of those I could not locate them.  On the side was the world's tiniest dish of dressing.  It was enough to drizzle over about one fourth of the salad.  I was in shock at the skimpy meal.  (Where are all of the lovely vegetables listed in the box on the menu??, I thought.) But I resigned myself to what I had ordered, thinking, well I will eat the beignets, and that will be enough.  Now... I've been to New Orleans. And I have understood beignets to be fried delicious little donuts.  When the ""beignets"" came out, they looked ok, but when I bit into one, I found out that it was not a donut or pastry at all.  No, sadly it was a slice of fried apple with the skin still on.  It tasted good, but was not what it purported to be.  When I told the waitress I was going to need to order more food than this, she just looked at me like I was somehow giving her a personal slight.  I changed my mind about ordering more food, at that point, just wanting to go home and eat a sandwich.  \n\nIn reading another review (Mikey Il, shoutout) I see that this is a restaurant specializing in small plates.  If I had an inkling that this was a small plate or tapas kind of place, clearly I would have ordered several more dishes.  Nobody told me this, and it was not apparent to anyone in my party.  One would think the server would have mentioned it, but no.  For the prices, and the way the menu described the food, I expected a full meal.  Not a large meal, just a meal.  That's all I wanted.\n\nAlso at the table-- my friend ordered the ""Dock Street Porter Pancakes with caramelized bananas, vanilla suds and crushed pretzels.""  She said the portion was enough, but that the food was ""just ok,"" Also, there were no crushed pretzels, just a few cheap looking pretzels sticks on the side of the plate.  My husband ordered the ""Red Velvet Waffles with sweet cream cheese mousse, toasted pecans and bourbon cherries.""  He said it was fine, nothing special.  It was a meal sized portion (a small meal, but not a caricature like my salad).  He also ordered the Bloody Mary, which he said tasted like it was made from a mix, and had very little alcohol.  \n\nBottom line, the food was not terrible, but if you are going to serve tapas (especially at those prices) you should really have your servers inform the patrons of such.  Hint-- people would also order more food if they knew the plates were for fashion models and sprites.",0,SIryf4yKw7VWcGhvggsoow

Pretty blah plate presentation with beige/brown waffles topped with a beige/brown chicken strips each and a little white container of cheap syrup all served on a white plate.  No garnish, no color.\n\nQuiche is baked in its' own individual portion casserole dish and served with a beet, poached pear and mesclun salad that was garnished with blue cheese.  The salad was tasty and the quiche was eh.  The casserole dish is lined with some type of flour ""crust.""  It was not buttery nor flaky.  They pour the egg mixture into the dough and bake it.  The dish is about 1-inch deep which makes a very shallow quiche-like entree.\n\nEggs Benedict is a traditional dish with a poached egg on top of Canadian bacon and English muffin.  The menu states that it is served with ""home fried potatoes.""  While this was not my entree, I will share that the hollandaise sauce seem a bit ""baked"" onto the plate (sitting under a heat lamp) and the potatoes wedges looked like oven roasted potatoes.  \n\nWere my expectations too high based on Yelp reviews?

We ordered three rolls, the shrimp tempura, salmon godzilla, and the angry dragon. The angry godzilla combined all your favorite ingredients into one big, lovely roll. Shrimp tempura, spicy tuna, mango, topped with spicy crab and yuzu miso sauce. I really loved the sauce. The sauce was fruity and earthy and savory and brought in all the ingredients together. OF course the shrimp tempura was bomb too, it had that nice crunch from the cucumber. The salmon godzilla had spicy salmon, avocado, sasago, and crunch.

This is the perfect restaurant for a celebration, with nice open space, and a cozy homey atmosphere. First, we ordered quite a few appetizers, my favorite was definitely the trio of spreads with the pita bread (especially the beet and green one), followed by the little fried cheese disk and then a little honey puff pastry with cheese inside. For the entrée I ordered the bass which was perfect, with the most amazing cauliflower and mixed veggies under. They were so creamy, rich and savory, I could eat just a whole bowl of them. I also sampled a few other dishes, but I think mine was my favorite. Then we got a few desserts to try. All were very good, but my favorite was the chocolate date cake with caramel sauce as well as the honey puff pasty with cheese inside. Our server was great, and we felt very welcome and taken care of. A must try in Philly!",2,uPr3t2M-OykA8M_oro7j1A

The staff kept refilling it which was very nice! \n\nThe uni sashimi was a little disappointing, besides the fact that it was very small in portion, the pairing was also a little strange because it was served over a piece of cucumber and small piece of mint. Uni, naturally doesn't have a lot of flavor, so the mint overpowered it all and pairing it with cucumber just didn't taste right to me. \nThe sashimi heaven was very good though, they served salmon belly as one of the raw fishes! I've never had it before and this definitely left an impression, I will definitely come back for more, all the other types of fish were pretty fresh. \nThe bubble fish roll and tuna princess roll were also very good, both with very flavorful. For any one they like specialty/ chef rolls these are a must try. \nMy boyfriend loved the salt baked chicken, he said that it reminded him of popcorn chicken, there's a specific spice in the chicken that I personally wasn't a fan of but my boyfriend really enjoyed it. But I have to say the texture of the chicken is very interesting, even though its called baked chicken, it is crispy like fried chicken but does have the oiliness of fried chicken.\n\nOverall even though the uni was an disappointment, the restaurant still serves quality sushi& sashimi, definitely with a try!\n\nThey take card but also have an ATM machine right by the door",1,IIg61VwXt1csqDOC4KXp-w

I have to say that my party and I were in a little bit of a rush to eat and get going.  The only place to eat at this location was outside in the terrace so we decided to stay despite the intense humidity.  Our waitress told us that she would be taking care of us (one look at her and how she looked and her uniform you expected the place to be no different than hooters where to waitstaff flirts for their tips, which is fine for the drunk and college crowd).  Here is the turning point. Our waitress ( I am now embarrassed to say that I never got her name) immediately saw that we were hot and uncomfortable and suggested that we go wait inside for a second while she secured a table for us inside.  Thirty seconds later we had our table.  She saw us using our phones to go online and suggested that we use the house wifi.  I couldn't get the password to work so she took my phone and attempted to do it herself (my phone was no working right, not her fault).  She suggested a lot of different foods and let us know what the specials were at that time of day and was honest to how they tasted.  It was prime time and she took the time to be sure we had what we needed the entire time we were there.  We settled on a seafood platter for around $48, which I DO NOT recommend as it was mostly fried pickles and french fries and only about 1/3 seafood. If I were to rate the restaurant based on this meal and the value of it, I would have left only 1 star. However, I got a andouille sausage wurst sandwich to go(another suggestion from our waitress) to go, which only cost $5 and I was not disappointed in the least.  Other members of my party ordered other items on the menu and thought the value was exceptional.  I wasn't supposed to get any sides with it due to it being a special but I believe I received fries and slaw with it anyway.  Upon asking for the check, I asked if they had a military discount.  Our waitress told me that she wasn't sure and would check for me (yeah, I heard that line before...but!) She really did ask management and got me a generous discount that was much more than I had thought I would have received!  A day earlier I was at an expensive 5 star restaurant ($700 check) where the food was only ok and the service was snobish to say the least.  It didn't occur to me until later in the evening that I had received  perhaps the best service in Philadelphia and the wurst sandwhich really was fantastic.  I was treated like a king and I would eat here daily if I lived in this city.  Eat here! Drink here!  Proper customer service is not dead here!",0,1fRmuK2kt5lAXEUQKbvW6A

The people were not unfriendly, but very business.  Their response to our requests for recommendations didn't really help us much, so we gave it stab by looks alone.  A nice selection of about 4-5 tarts, 4-5 cookies, a few cupcakes, and random baked goods like the lemon tart. Prices are a little steep, but what the heck.\n\nPicked out the sugar cookie and apple crumb tart. Sugar cookie was crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, exactly as I like it, but wasn't blown away. Can a sugar cookie do that though? Maybe not. But the apple crumb tart was really good - perfect crunchy brown sugar top, apple goodness in the center, and most importantly, a really flaky but consistent tart at the bottom.

I booked a reservation for 2 for my first wedding anniversary weeks in advance and asked for the most romantic spot in the restaurant and I booked a early time so we can partake in the happy hour oysters that they have. When we came in I told the host that I had reservations and gave her my name. She asked did we want to sit indoor our outside, we chose indoor. I reiterated that I requested the most romantic table or section they had, she proceeded to take us to a booth in the middle of the dining room floor, but that's neither her or there. Then Connor, our waiter told us that happy hour was only at the bar, but he will find out for us. He comes back and tells us that they are not doing happy hour today. I was confused and told him that I called and asked about this and they confirmed that they do have happy our the day that we will be dining in. He told me that that what he was told and asked if I would like to speak with a manager in which I obliged. I believe the manager's name was Christine , and she told me that it being a holiday they do not do happy hour on holidays and apologized for the misunderstanding and offered us 6 oysters. So we ordered a dozen and a half of oysters, calamari and ceviche. The oysters were fresh and calamari was awesome. The ceviche was delicious as well but towards the end we found a fly in the bottom. We bought it to Connor's attention and he apologized and told us because of the windows being open in the front, is why they had flies.

VERY small. The grill and food prep area takes up at least half the cinder-block shack. The other half is where everyone waits to order. On-premises eating area is entirely outside, with half the tables under a roof.\n\nSecondly, it can be chaotic. Depending on what you want, you may need to order from different people at different places. You don't have to give your order in some secret language like the asshats at Pat's and Geno's may ask, but you will need to pay attention to what's going on so you don't hold things up.\n\nThird, John's cash only. I add points for this because people who use cards for anything under $10 annoy the piss out of me.\n\nFourth, John's has very limited hours, usually 9am-4pm or so. Saturdays only during the summer, closed on weekends for the winter. No dinner service. I always take this as a good sign: if a place doesn't need to be open all the time to maintain a steady customer base, they must be doing something right.\n\nRegarding the food, John's has some of the best hot Philly-style sandwiches in the city. The roast pork is strong with garlic, rich and moist, best served with the sharp provolone and spinach. The cheese steak is hearty but not greasy at all; my favorite the pizza steak with onions, mozzarella, and sauce. They slice their steak daily from fresh rib-eye, resulting in a succulent and tender steak. Definitely among the top 3 in the city, and much better than any cheese steak shop that has bright lights, neon signs, or must include the word ""Famous"" in their name in order to get people to eat there. Bottom line, at John's they know how to work the grill.\n\nMy recommendation? Go there with a couple friends and get a few different sandwiches and a couple of Tastykakes. Sit outside at the picnic table across the street from a run down chemical plant, cut up the sandwiches to share, and then finish the meal with your Butterscotch Krimpets and Kandy Kakes. You can't get much more Philly than that.",4,gfWTee4CnQF-shBgAsvI9g

As a grown man I knew eating two sandwiches was not remotely possible but I needed to fulfill my hoagie experience while in south philly.

Overall a good 4 star sandwich. \n\nNow the roast pork was a whole different experience. The meat was juicy and flavorful leaving each bite more addicting!  The bread was most likely dipped in the jus, leaving the bread a lil soggy but not enough for it to be mush. Same dipping concept for Italian beef in Chicago!

The hostess was kind of rude and unapproachable, and upon being seated the light above our table kept turning on and off to the point of it being really annoying. The manager did offer for us to move to another table, which was nice, but being halfway through our meal when she finally approached us, it wasn't worth it. \n\nOn to the food: the calamari was delicious! Light and battered perfectly. Definitely a must-try. As for my entree, I ordered the swordfish and it was totally under seasoned. We had to ask the server for salt and pepper to add a little oomph to it. My mom had the ahi tuna which she enjoyed, but noted it lacked seasoning as well. My dad ordered the mahi mahi which came out totally raw. My dad has been in the restaurant business for 35 years, and hardly ever sends food back. The server who we were finally able to flag down was incredibly dismissive, grabbing my dad's plate and not acknowledging the issue at all. Totally not the way to handle a $35-$40 piece of fish when we were incredibly polite about the situation. \n\nOverall the food wasn't bad but,for the price, the selections as well as the customer service could have used a bit of seasoning.

I'm a crazy bitch and decided to literally, I'm not joking, order take out while waiting to pay the bill from my main dinner. Let me explain.\n\nI don't usually eat carbs these days but I was the wildest carb bitch back in the day. Being a vegetarian doesn't give you many options and carbs are FUCKING DELICIOUS. Having said that shit, I'm also a travel bitch and I've been fortunate enough to taste the divine ecstasy that is hummus in israel. I could go through a tub of that bliss in probably 2 days, and did so more often than not. I've had dizengoff. I've had zahav. I've had hummusology. I've had isot. I've made zahav's hummus myself from the nytimes cooking website before I even know wtf zahav was. Hummus was the most painful staple of my diet to be clawed out of my stone-cold dead corpse hand when I decided to cut out carbs. \n\nI knew in the periphery of my consciousness that a new hummus place opened up but this knowledge was repressed because I ""don't eat hummus anymore"". I was asked at work if I've tried hummus republic and NO I HAVE NOT BC I DON'T EAT CARBS, REMEMBER? It's been a sore spot, needless to say. \n\nI was a bad girl last week and this past weekend. After completely gorging myself with nachos I knew this was my opportunity to try this place. Similarly to peeing in the ocean, what's a few more carbs? My pancreas has had ample time to rest up for this marathon. A milkshake from nearby shake shack wasn't out of the question either.\n\nI placed a pick up order on yelp. I wanted something simple, quick hummus and pita side and some falafel balls. \n\nFood was ready significantly earlier than projected, which was appreciated. \n\nBoth hummus and chips were good. Hummus is definitely not the best I've had but it is much better than average. Philly's hummus scene is actually pretty boast-worthy so it's hard to compete. This hummus was good but I can't say it beats out dizengoff which is close by. \n\nI'm actually not generally a huge falafel fan but this was possibly one of the best falafel I've had in the US. I'm not saying it's outrageously authentic but it TASTES GOOD. \n\nIt looks like this place also has a lot of options with mix and match capabilities.

The bread was a little toasty with sesame seeds and therefore had some crunch to it while giving it a little interesting twist. The wiz and steak were also great. It wasn't drenched in wiz and I actually enjoyed that a lot more since the focus was on the steak and the wiz just helped to give it a little more moist texture.\n\nThe roast pork had the same bread, but was a lot more soggy (I guess from the stew it was in) and that ruined some of my favorite parts of the bread.

I usually go with salmon and the portions are very generous here (which is great!!). Then you get unlimited toppings so go crazy with your creation. The toppings are great as well - they have a good selection of veggies (and even mangos) and toppings.

I did a lot of research about Philly cheesesteaks and decided to go to this place based on various reviews. The drive to find the place was interesting. The smell emitting from the little shop was delicious. There was a really long line which seemed to bode well for the food. I was willing to play along and wait. My companion and I both got cheesesteaks with onions and sharp provolone and sodas to wash it down. Unfortunately it was honestly kind of a let down and seemed a bit overrated. \n\nWe both agreed that the meat was just kind of dry and lacking flavor. The bread was also a little stiff, as in, it didn't seem completely fresh. Usually a sandwich like this should be really juicy but at the end, the bottom of my sandwich was dry and almost stale. The onions were nice. It is hard to mess up a grilled onion. Also, the sandwich wasn't bad. It was certainly hot and edible. It was just kind of lacking in flavor and I wasn't incredibly impressed with the meat.\n\nI'd try the roast pork maybe if I am here or I might try someplace else.

The meat is chunky slices and the onions are pretty chunky as well (mixed in, not in top). I think the only thing I would've changed is putting some whiz on top.

The vegan dan-dan noodles were flavorful (but my spice-loving friends said it was not spicy at all, I thought it had a bit of a kick), and I enjoyed the jerk chicken bao buns (you get two, so it's a great deal for HH!)\n\nI docked one star because they need to figure out their credit card/tab situation. Me and my friend got to Attico early and grabbed a drink at the bar for happy hour. We each put down credit cards and said ""sure"" when they asked if we wanted to keep our tabs open.

This was a server space, but our server said he could transfer our tabs over to the group bill.

He confirmed (after checking) that we were all set. \n\nOn my way to the bathroom (which was clean, 10/10 would recommend to pee here), I stopped at the bar to ask bartender from before if he could confirm my tab was closed and moved over to the group's bill as I had moved outside. He said I would need to check with my server. \n\nI ended up settling up by cash, and for some reason I was a little nervous so I returned to the bartender to ask if he could double check that my tab was closed. He (a little gruffly) told me that he had no way of checking on the system if my tab was still open. \n\nMy friends ended up asking our server again to make sure, and we checked the bill and it all seemed fine/covered everything. \n\nI made a point to check my credit card later, and sure enough they charged me.

I wouldn't say the food is mind-blowing, but it was pretty tasty. My favorite was the salt baked chicken, which had an interesting flavor and was very tender while crispy on the outside. The Marilyn Monroll was also a solid sushi option for the price, though I have had better sushi at higher-end sushi places in town. I was a bit surprised by the pork sung onigiri, because I've never had pork sung like the one here, which was drier/crumblier/saltier than I'm used to.

They close around three, and I tried to eat there at five (so much for spontaneity!).\n\nWhen I tried again (after researching the hours properly this time), I was absolutely blown away. My companion and I knew the cheesesteaks were supposed to be amazing, but I was really in the mood for a roast pork sandwich, so we got a large one of each and set to. Oh my God. They were heaven in wrappers. \n\nTo start with the cheesesteak: the cheese was well-melted throughout and quite gooey. We chose the mild provolone for this sandwich and it was a perfect choice-- the flavor of the provolone cut straight through the onion and meat and was a perfect complement. The meat and onion had a good ratio and both were well-chopped and blended together (I hate hate stringy chunks of onion, so this was a plus). It was moist, but the roll held up pretty well until we overloaded it with ketchup. A 5/5. \n\nThe roast pork: dare I say, it was as good as DiNic's? They don't roast the pork on premises, I believe, but it didn't matter. The pork was cut into perfect slices and cheese was again melted well. I chose the sharp provolone, which weirdly enough had less flavor than the mild... but that may have been my tastebuds that day. They don't offer broccoli rabe, but they do offer spinach. Now, not being a fan of spinach kept me from putting it onto the sandwich, but I'm sure it would have added an extra element of awesome. Still a stellar sandwich with enough juices to be easy to munch. 5/5.\n\nThe service was fast and the place was tiny-- I'm glad it was not a cold day or a long line, because the only seating is outside.

That day was yesterday July 20, 2019. I ordered the roast pork-plain, and a cheese steak hoagie. I sat it the shade at one of the restaurant's picnic tables and ate the roast pork. I was pleasantly surprised when I unwrapped the paper to find a piping hot sandwich. They don't hold back on the meat either, umm. Then, I took my first bite....wow! Delicious and flavorful. Though not needed, because the sandwich is juicy I added a little mayo (personal preference), but think it would have been even better with horseradish. Recommend!",1,NHY0um0XDKPses6DkQzwLw

I definitely came by hungry and ordered BOTH their Roast Pork sandwich and their Cheesesteak which I heard was actually better than their Roast Pork.   And after finally trying both, let me just say that their Roast Pork is awesome and their Cheesesteak is ridiculous!\n\nOrdering a sandwich here can be a little confusing though for first timers and I learned that the hard way.  Even though it starts off as one line, it then splits into two lines with one for Cheesesteaks and one for Roast Pork.  I didn't know this right away and went to the Roast Pork line but forgot to order a Cheesesteak first.  Luckily, since the line was short at the time, I went back to the end and started over and ordered the Cheesesteak first and then ordered the Roast Pork right after.\n\nRoast Pork with spinach and provolone -- http://bit.ly/2vlt50v\nYeah, this is a serious pork sandwich.  Sorry, DiNic's.  As much as I enjoy their Roast Pork sandwich, John's Roast Pork sandwich has become my favorite.  I think it's the spinach that makes it work better for me since it's not as bitter as broccoli rabe, and I love that they completely doused my sandwich with their gravy, which actually made it easier to eat since the bread was soaked.  The gravy added so much more flavor to the tender pork.  It was so good!!!\n\nCheesesteak with American cheese -- http://bit.ly/2vlfGFV\nOh man, this cheesesteak.  You can't see it from the pic, but the sandwich was overflowing with steak on each end.  It was so much steak that I couldn't fit the whole cheesesteak in the frame.  I loved it!  Even though I prefer Cheez Whiz, I thought their use of American cheese was brilliant since it almost had the same flavor as Whiz but without the drippy mess since it's cooked well within the steak.  This is probably my favorite cheesesteak in all of Philly and I might even say that I liked it even more than their own Roast Pork.\n\nJohn's Roast Pork totally lived up to the hype for me and I'm glad that I had a chance to stop by.  Both sandwiches were epic and I would love to go back again and for another round!  Till next time, John's!",25,F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw

Three years ago Bru was the hot new party spot with a trendy self-pouring beer wall and lots of taps pouring good stuff. But now.... Bru is a top contender of being one of the best beer bars in Philadelphia, which earns its 5th star from me.\n\nI come to Bru ALL the time, so that must mean I like it! Bru always has rare craft beers pouring. They are changing every day, but it can be common to find gems from Avery, Russian River, Hill Farmstead, Firestone Walker, Funky Buddha, Jolly Pumpkin, Lost Abbey, Cascade, Perennial, the list goes on. They do an amazing job stocking Belgian beers as well as German beers. \n\nAlso, another reason for 5 stars, they handle large special beer events very well. They will frequently have ""tap takeovers"" and stack their taps with rare beers that everyone wants. So, the place can get packed during these rare events, but Bru staff are always prepared, and experienced at controlling the crowds. They sometimes give out drink tickets for the really rare beers, and oddly enough, the service at the tables is just as good as the bar! The waitresses understand the beer, and the uniqueness and demand, and do a great job accommodating us beer nerds. \n\nPhilly Beer week has basically turned into ""Philly Bru Week"" because their events and beers are so good, I'm always here!

We both really like sushi, so we figured we had to try it. It's SOOO good. We tried both the Salmon and the Tuna Burger. They basically have rice buns with a sheet of seaweed and then a bunch of filling. While the salmon one was good, the tuna one was amazing. The tuna was perfectly done and and seemed like it was seared on the side and was paired so well with the crab, avocado, sauces, etc. The fried onion also gave it more texture. I am literally drooling writing this review. We also tried the Mars sushi roll, which I really liked but my boyfriend wasn't as much of a fan of since he doesn't love cream cheese.

The better they are, the less frequently they are allowed to be open.  The 24 hour tourist traps are pretty bad, and at the other end of the spectrum, you have John's\n\nYou pretty much have to live or work in South Philly to get a chance to go to John's, because they keep bankers hours.  And when they say they close at 3, they mean 3 is when the bread is usually gone, so don't think you can sneak in a 2:40, I've been there late as they started surveying the line to figure out who would get the last roll.  Despite a lot of praise from all corners, John's remains largely off the beaten path, with much longer lines at the other cheesesteak institutions.\n\nThat being said, if you ever have a weekday off, you need to get here.  Both the cheesesteaks and the roast pork sandwiches vie for the title of best in the city.  The rolls are fantastic, lightly seeded with a good thick crust and a light but not spongy breadiness.  The pork is perfectly seasoned and nicely juicy.  As a bonus, most of the people in line are waiting for a cheesesteak, so you can jump to the front for a roast pork and other non grilled items.  Definitely get the pork with sharp provolone and spinach, its really is a marriage made in heaven.\n\nThe cheesesteaks are cooked to order on a big griddle.  Unlike the assembly lines of Passyunk avenue, cheese whiz is verboten here, provolone is the cheese of choice, and they expertly melt it into the meat.   Their menu has a good variety of cheesesteak offerings, including chicken cheesesteaks, but I prefer to keep to the classic. They also make cold hoagies, but the point is the hot sandwiches.\n\nLike any great steak shop, they have no indoor seating and limited outdoor seating.  The building itself is on an island between some railroad tracks, the strip malls on Snyder ave, and an imposing factory.  It  makes a great place to grab lunch while shopping along Delaware ave, as it is right between the Target and the Ikea down there.",4,dioXbYFdMCyE7zCK90eM3Q

I did not like the. To try and not wast anymore money on this meal i ate the filling and threw away the ""wonton"". The red velvet cheesecake was dry and just not good.

It was a sweltering 96-degree day and the pork wasn't the only thing getting roasted. We ordered a large sweet pepper cheesesteak and a small roast pork sandwich with spinach and sharp provolone. Our wait in line was about 15 minutes. We ordered at 2:30, and as we did we were told they only had 17 ""large size"" rolls left. After that, their sandwich options change. So, get here early or risk losing out.\n\nThe sandwiches were good. The cheesesteak came with white American cheese which was nice and melted, but I wanted more peppers. I also missed the Whiz that other places offer. The meat was stringy and thin but not chewy. The roast pork sandwich was also good though I wish the ingredients were mixed about instead of layered (cheese, meat, spinach). My wife thought that the bread was too soggy but since I ate my part quickly I didn't mind. \n\nWhat I didn't like was that it was hot... even in the shade. They didn't have areas to wash your hands after, which I think is essential after chowing on cheesesteaks. They automatically give you only one napkin per sandwich, which is woefully deficient, but provided more upon request.\n\nAfter having cheesesteaks here, at Pat's and at Geno's, I must say I like them all.

It was a slow time for them, between lunch and dinner, which to me was very relaxing and also provided for very attentive service. \n\nThe only thing that I ordered was the lobster bisque ($10), which came in a wide bowl and with oyster crackers on the side, like any good seafood soup should. I thought this one of the best lobster bisques I've ever tasted! The bisque had the perfect rich, creamy consistency that it should have, and the lobster flavor was excellent. Swimming throughout were chunks of lobster meat, even tail. Beyond that, it was seasoned very well, and while I can't recall exactly what the seasoning or spices were, I can tell you it's enough to keep the dish interesting on the palate and contrast the richness. \n\nOn a side note, one thing that's mildly astonishing is how big Devon is!

Note: the restaurant is pretty big, but was still completely full, but that might have been due to it being restaurant week. In any case, I'd recommend making a reservation just to be safe.\n\nTo start the meal, we received amazing biscuits served with tasty maple butter (and yes, you can ask for more...we definitely did). We also received the calamari plate from the Yelp check-in offer, which tasted great and was very generous in size.\n\nFor my appetizer, I ordered the Caesar salad, which was undoubtedly my least favorite meal of the night. It wasn't bad, just not much better than Caesar salad that you would get at a typical pizza shop. The star dish of the night was definitely the scallops, which were perfectly seared and paired with delicious lobster risotto (perfect scallops and risotto...Gordon Ramsay would be so proud!). The apple croudtade was basically apple bread pudding and was flavorful while not being overly sweet, though it was a little dry. However, that was likely because I asked to not receive the ice cream the dish generally comes with since I don't generally consume heavy dairy. With the ice cream I can't imagine the cake being dry.\n\nThe service was excellent throughout the night, and the portion sizes were large---I had seared scallops and risotto for lunch the next day as well.

So I called ahead a week in advance to ask if they were accepting larger parties as I was getting married and staying at the Cambria Hotel and wanted to bring my bridal party for drinks the night before the wedding. Whoever I spoke to must have been new or did not understand because when I asked if they were accepting parties of 8, I was told that would be fine-they could seat us in the lounge area and any additional  people were free to stand at the bar for drinks. So I made the reservation for 8 people at 7:30PM. At 7:30PM I am waiting downstairs in the lobby, not allowed to go up, even though I have a reservation. I ask if any of my party has arrived, they say no. Me and 1 other member of my party are not allowed upstairs until 8:15- 45 minutes I had to wait even though I had a reservation! Once I'm upstairs I see that 2 people from my party are already there! When I get settled and ready to order a drink I'm approached by the manager Stacey saying I'm not allowed to have 8 people in my party (even tho they allowed the reservation) and that they could possibly squeeze two extra chairs in (at this point there are 4 guests). I tell her there are 4 people waiting downstairs who are not being let up and she says that there's nothing they can do and that they have other reservations coming in. I wasn't even able to get my entire party of 8 seated! The rest of my guests were left in the lobby!!! I was thoroughly disappointed. If the reservations are only for 6 then they need to communicate with each other before booking larger parties. When I tried to talk to Stacey to see if anything could be done because I still had guests downstairs she was beyond rude telling me that nothing could be done. I asked if they could come up and stand at the bar, she said no. No apology, no attempt at a solution. I get it was a busy Saturday night and she was probably flustered already with the volume of people, but I was expecting better customer service from the manager. So we decided to leave, I didn't even get to order a drink, after 45 minutes of waiting! The best part was when we left the elevator ""security guard""  told us to NEVER COME BACK. As if we started a bar fight or did something ridiculous! What was supposed to be a relaxing and fun night before my wedding day turned out to be a complete disaster.

Super tender pork that's very juicy. The broth is slightly sweet and extremely salty - could tone it back just a bit. Served with spinach instead of broccoli rabe, which makes it much less bitter than other roast pork sandwiches and puts the focus on the meat itself. If you want some complexity to the sandwich, order it with sharp provolone. The soft roll absorbs all the juices and has a nice crust on the outside, helping hold the sandwich together.\n\nCheesesteak - 5/5 stars - Has all the elements of a great cheesesteak and is definitely one of my favorites. The meat is tasty and doesn't have tough pieces like some other places. I used to prefer whiz but John's has turned me into an american cheese fan (they only offer american, mild provolone and sharp provolone).

We replaced the pork with halibut ($2 extra or so).  It was decent. A meal for 2. I was def full.\n\nThe individual tacos are small. \nOther members got the enchiladas and I think they were very happy with it.\n\nThe waitstaff- very pleasant and attentive.\n\nOverall, not a place I would go back to to (except to get that tasty ass corn on the cob).

Apparently, two people on Yelp found the staff to be less than par, which was completely different than my experience and most others that I've read. God forbid the cups aren't stacked in a perfect line, the tongs are not placed at a 37 degree angle from the muffins, a single coffee grind makes its way onto counter.

My boyfriend and I first tried Hawthornes (1 hour wait) then called over to Sabrina's (1 hour 15 minute wait). After choice one and two were nixed, we started brainstorming where to go next.

I haven't been to the Falafel King or Magic Carpet yet but this is tied with (if not slightly tastier than) Alyans in my book. It's a healthy and heartier alternative to fast food. Mama's packs your pita with falafel balls, a shredded lettuce mix, cucumbers, tomatoes, humus, tahini, and so forth. Upon ordering they also offer a spicy option that is some additional sauce, it's very good and allows me some sort of variation upon visiting. Their signature combo consists of a large falafel, a generous serving of fries, and a soda or water for $8.50. I've always taken left overs home so it's definitely worth the price. I'm a sucker for combos but they also serve individual (and smaller sized) falafel, platters, and soups. \n\nThe only inconveniencing facet of Mama's is their schedule. As other yelpers have pointed out, they close on Jewish holidays. However in my experience whenever a fast food or hole in the wall has a challenging schedule that often inconveniences the customer (i.e. mostly every cheesesteak spot which I love ever) it often means that the food is very good! Plus if you're unfamiliar with Jewish holidays that is nothing that a quick Google search can't remedy. \n\nI highly encourage anyone to make the pilgrimage to Mama's. This falafel possess the power to cure hunger, poverty, blindness, the recession, the gender gap, etc. I'm just playin but it is a healthy decision for your next meal!",1,nr17ttvU3byj1me5kjCY0Q

The waiters and waitresses wear colorful plaid shirts which was cute and they were all very nice.  I didn't order any drinks but there is a counter leftover from the Midtown Diner that the restaurant used to be where you can order drinks and food from if you don't feel like sitting at one of the tables or booths.  Each wall has unusual stuff to look at and examine and each booth is named after a type of car, I believe, which was also interesting.  I had the Chorizo, steak and chicken tacos which were all really tasty.  The chips and salsa are good too.  The tortillas are very tasty and soft and there is fresh onions and cilantro on each taco.  The tacos are very flavorful albeit small.  They kept the general infrastructure of the old Midtown Diner but really did a crazy thorough job with decorating the place.

We liked all of those little appetizers, particularly the potato and kimchi. When our Dolsot arrived, we were also served miso soup, with radish cubes rather than the traditional tofu. The Dolsot itself was very tasty. I like mine with a little soy sauce, and had to ask for some.

The decor was nothing special to comment on, so onto the food. I ordered a miso ramen, & so did my boyfriend, while my sister ordered the karai (spicy) ramen. I know that this is a self service establishment, so why were some customers getting their names called to grab their food, while others had their noodles delivered to them? If it's a self service establishment, then keep it that way, as to not confuse customers or it will seem as some customers are receiving preferential treatment.\n\nThe staff at Nom Nom were very accommodating & friendly, & the noodles came out fairly quickly after we had ordered. The broth of the miso ramen was milky, with a good pork flavor mixed with a tinge of miso. The pork was a little chewy, but only had a thin strip of fat, which is what I like. The noodles were a bit chewier than al-dente but went well with the soup. The only gripe I had was that the egg was whole, and not soft & ooey-gooey on the inside, but hey at least you get a whole egg instead of half of one, right? My sister seemed to enjoy her karai ramen, but stated that it was nowhere near spicy.\n\nNom Nom seems to be adjusting well & I hope that the quality of their ramen only increases as time passes.",0,jklCtvLWbkuoBiw60i1g3g

The chalk board menu lends itself to the whole Mamas ""experience"". \n\nThe service is fast and they get you in and out as soon as possible. I haven't eaten there- but you order, get your plate, and sit. There is a sign encouraging you to share tables which I happen to love. They temporarily ran out of falafel while I was waiting- but the last of the batch was put in the fluffy pita that was to be my sandwich. I am currently pregnant, and  I joked that baby was hungry and wanted falafel and the gentleman grabbed a tiny plate- and took that falafel out  and said ""for the baby!"". Then I got a stuffed grape leaf from the other lady who was behind the counter. \n\nSo lets talk about the after I got home and beasted this meal.\n\nOh.My.Goodness.\n\nHow do you say ""absolute very best falafel ever"" in Hebrew? \nI am so happy that I ate this for dinner. I ate an entire large falafel sandwich. I'm not full, and not hungry. It was a perfectly made, perfectly balanced portion. The falafel itself was a crunchy- while not greasy- flavorful ball of chick pea perfection. The pita was a fluffy masterpiece artfully constructed with the aplomb of a master craftsman.

Now, it isn't exactly like you are surrounded by pine trees sitting in front of a giant bonfire, but roasting marshmallows and then squeezing them between some chocolate and graham crackers in the city is still pretty neat.

As a foodie and beer lover, I felt very at home at Devil's Den. \nIt seems that a lot of reviewers are complaining about the re-invention of their menu, but I think it's great that they're offering more thoughtful, refined dishes. One of the things that plagues my beer drinking experiences is going to a bar/pub with a decent to amazing beer selection and getting stuck with menu choices like buffalo wings and burgers. Come on people, been there done that a thousand times before, show me a lil' creativity!\nMy boyfriend and I came here more for the beer and truthfully were not expecting much from the food. We had the bacon wrapped dates, open faced crab ravioli and the braised pork flatbread. All three dishes were impressive. Bacon wrapped dates are becoming a common little trend amongst menus these days and in the words of McDonalds, I'm lovin' it. These were no exception. \nAlthough the presentation of the crab ravioli was odd (who the hell makes ""open-faced"" ravioli??), the flavors were absolutely delicious! I can't stop thinking about this dish and it has fueled my choices at dinners since then; I keep ordering dishes with crabmeat everywhere I go. I think with a little refinement, this dish could easily be on a more upscale menu.\nThe pork flatbread was also great. Flavors and textures all lived up to my standards and it was a delicious dish that could please all crowds.\nThe beer selection, as most of you know, was pretty amazing.

I understand new employees, but if they're messing up this much, they really need to be told (hence me posting this now). This $16 meal is now an appetizer.\n\nUpdate: \n\nEmailed the manager, twice, as was requested on here, never heard back. :/ Decided to give this place another try and ordered pickup through Caviar. Got my bowl and it was missing two ingredients (only 5 toppings to begin with), including the avocado I paid an extra $1.50 for. \n\nI don't know what the deal is with this place and don't know why the manager would tell me to email them when they wouldn't even email me back..maybe just to save face on Yelp?

We told him about how the hostess told us very specifically that the ""small plates"" were half-off (found in the dinner menu) and that we wanted them to honor this.  He said there was nothing he could do and so I asked to speak to the manager.  The waiter said that the manager wasn't available but the acting manager was the bartender, who I have met many times in the way that one would be familiar with the bartender at the neighborhood bar. When I told him what happened he said ""Well you're here all the time, you should KNOW it's the tapas that are half off, not the small plates"". I told him that I had never been there for happy hour before and emphasized that the hostess TOLD US that the ""small plates"" were on special. He wouldn't budge. We left unhappy less because of having to spend an extra few dollars but more because of the ""every man for himself"" feeling that you would never expect from a neighborhood bar. \n\nThe management have made it clear that they are more concerned with making every last cent from their patrons than forging a relationship with the community.

My sorority sister / best friend from college was randomly coming through Philadelphia, as she was traveling for business.

At this point, we should have known things were too good to be true!  \n\nI was going to go with Jones or Strangelove, but since we are both watching our waist lines these days, we opted for healthier / lighter fare and decided on Le Pain Quotidien.

You are thinking ... well maybe these two ancient sorority girls ordered a meal w/ a lot of preparation.  Au contraire mon french frere, we both ordered SALADS.  \n\nI ordered the Nicoise - totally underwhelming except for the slice of anchovy on top.  And Samantha ordered the Caprese salad, which is so much so her favorite, that she has it at least once a week!  Unfortunately, she said that this $14+ Caprese ranked at one of the worst she has ever had.  Well, its a sad day for Philly when a Pittsburgh gal is in town, and has a terrible meal (womp, womp) but I guess I (not my fare city of Philly) should take the fall for this, since afterall, I'm the one who chose LPQ.\n\nAlso our waiter was sorta awkward in avoiding the huge elephant in the room - the fact that it took 40+ minutes for 2 salads.

So this review isn't for their main dining menu. (My fiancé went during main dining hours, see below)\n\nWHAT WE GOT: Tacos (steak, chicken, fish, cheese), empanadas, nachitos with vegetable salsa\n\nPROS: Well definitely the price of their happy hour menu for one. All tacos are $1 and their small appetizer plates are $2-$3 depending on what you get. In this case for us, the empanadas were $2 and the nachitos were $3. The tacos tasted pretty average, nothing super special so I guess you get what you pay for. The star of the show was probably the margarita I got. First of all, it was $5. Second of all, it was cantaloupe mint flavored. Oh my gosh it was fantastic. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Also the wait staff were all super friendly and helpful. They misheard one of our orders and brought us the nachitos by accident (we didn't originally order it) so our waiter gave it to us on the house. \n\nCONS: Lets put it this way, happy hour is hectic. And it shows in the food. The taco shells were flaccid and cold and the meat in the tacos were dry. But you could get lucky and get a freshly made taco, in which case they end up tasting a lot better. The empanadas were also 90% fried dough and 10% filling so basically I couldn't taste anything more than the skin. \n\nFIANCÉ'S CORNER: Their main dining hours has much higher quality food. Went with a friend, got the nachos ($12) and we each got an order of tacos (3 tacos, $8-10). Nachos are in very large portions, very tasty and good. Tacos are a bit pricey but outside of happy hour, the quality is much better and honestly pretty worth it.",1,0vnF9En8gZfjipND_pzF4w

Quite honestly its quantity over quality. I had enough food for 3 small dinners on their own for the price of 35$ (at restaurant week). So as you can tell, I was quite full at the end.

As someone who makes poached eggs frequently, this was completely unacceptable. Generally, eggs are poached for roughly three minutes, give or take a minute, depending on water temperature. I would be surprised if these got more than one.\n\nAfter consuming one slice of bread to alleviate my hunger, I brought the dish to the register to let them know that an egg was served raw and that I could not consume it.

I personally do not really want to try upscale italian restaurants unless they are 4.5/5 stars in Philly because pasta can just be really basic. I wanted to be impressed, and this place did not disappoint.\n\nFirst off, I love how this place reminds me of Eataly in NYC - they sell supplies here, have their own gelato shop, hold classes, show how they cook, etc. It's pretty damn cool.\n\nThe dishes were all great. Here's the lowdown:\n\nBruschette: Good, nothing special. What you would expect. 3.5/5\n\nMozzarella Tasting: Very very good - first off the tomato doesn't even taste like normal tomato, and I hate tomatoes-  not sure what they did to it but it tasted like such a sweet fruit I never had before. It paired sooooo well with the mozzarella. 4.25/5\n\nPolipo: some of the better octopus I've had. Crunchy yet chewy and very very tender. 4/5\n\nCinghiale: Nothing special. Just a regular meatball in my opinion. 3.25/5\n\nPappardelle al ragu Aquilano: A simple above average pasta dish. I don't think there was anything too special about it other than it being just well done. However, I am really really glad I got this dish because the acidic taste of the dish paired so so well with the agnoletti (described below). I recommend getting those two dishes together. 3.75/5\n\nAgnoletti: Literally, the best ravioli I've ever had in my life. Never had anything like this before. Honeslty can't describe what's inside since there was so many ingredients that combined so well together for a flavor outburst. It was so creative to put the truffle on top, giving the overall dish a sense of sweetness, but not sugar sweet you would expect in like a dessert. I would highly recommend pairing it with the pappardelle (above) because they are on opposite ends of the taste spectrum and balance each other out well. Going back and forth eating the two let's you appreciate them at their extremes. A very clear 5/5 in my book.\n\nGelato: Oh my goodness, this gelato. The best I've ever had, even compared to what is in Italy. The texture, the depth of flavor, the different types of tastes that come at you, so beautifully done. Any dark chocolate flavors will be very rich and deep in the chocolate flavor. However, please please try the pistachio. It might seem like a basic flavor, but I even bought a pint to take home with me because it was so damn good. When I put it in my mouth, literally 4 different types of pistachio flavors come at me, from start to finish one by one.\n\nDefinitely coming back again. What a cool, amazingly delicious restaurant. Well done! Five stars all the way",4,GIWnx-J3aTbWxK8plZNQsQ

I had really low expectations from reading some of the reviews. I eat a lot so portions are a dispositive factor for me.  I prepared by eating a bowl of cereal before heading to the restaurant - again - I EAT A LOT!\n\nLike so many other restaurants in Philadelphia, the restaurant is small and intimate. The entrance is right on on the street (I was expecting to walk inside a hotel first) and the first thing that comes into sight is a welcoming bar area followed by a tres romantic courtyard to the left hand side. I would definitely go back when its warmer to dine in the courtyard. \n\nWe started with a mixed cheese plate.  I thought it was so cool how each cheese was paired with a difference sauce -the softest one with cranberries, medium with with plums puree, and gouda with miso sauce.  (I am a noob when it comes to cheese plates because I don't usually order it). The gouda with miso sauce was my favorite, I would have never thought to pair those two together!!! \n\nFor entrees we ordered the monk fish, short ribs, and ox tail.  Yes, the portions are not like the size of fried rice at a chinese restaurant but it was A LOT bigger than I anticipated. Definitely NOT bite sized. Also, the a la carte menu notes that that the entrees are small plates and suggests to order 3 or more so its not like false advertising was involved. All the entrees were prepared with thought and effort and beautifully plated. Each entree was less than $20, which I thought was really reasonable compared to some of the other restaurants that I have been to.",2,bCsS9EJOBTIxRGiqixB5rw

The server, as he was guiding us, told us not to be so intimidated by the menu because all the entree's are just in 2 pages. What a relief! You kind of have to see for yourself, but i think another reason why i felt so intimidated was because.. since this IS an authentic Italian restaurant, most of the dishes are in Italian. However, it does have descriptions on the titles. It also helped when our server was kind enough to explain what entrees were what and how they will come, etc. \n\nWe ordered a Pepate Di Cozze and Polipo for our appetizer.\nLinguine Granchio and Spaghetti Vongole for our entrees. \nLastly, Gelato (Creme Caramel and pistachio) and White Chocolate Bread Pudding for dessert! \nThey were incredibly delicious and the portions were just right!

So, don't be afraid to ask what is what and what you would like in your meal. I was going to order some sweet sausage and asked if i could have spaghetti with sauce with it and they said yes. They were willing to make it work. I ended up not ordering it because I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and really taste what this restaurant has to truly offer. But! I just wanted to show that the servers are willing to change up the menu just to be able to go with what you are in the mood for! I absolutely love how flexible they are with their menu and how they don't give you a hard time They also have complementary unlimited bread and olive oil with the choice of having parmigiano and pepper to go with it (i recommend it with, give it a try.)\n\nI also want to add that being in this restaurant kind of makes you forget that you're in the city.

Horrible Horrible Operations at this location!!  \n\nPlease Cosi Management - send someone who knows what they are doing to set some standards at this location!!\n\nSampling of various visits over the last 4 months.  \n\n1.  As other reviewers commented, there are 2 lines, one for sandwiches and the other for salads.  The lines are ""loose"" - you can usually order from either line - the people behind the counter don't seem to care.  Nor do they care if someone walks up ahead of you and orders, they don't really notice who is in line.  There is no semblance of order.  \n\n2.  The menu clearly states a price for Half Salad and Full Salad.  I tried to order a half salad and the person making my salad (who has worked there as long as I have been going there - 4 months) told me I can only get a half salad if I get a Half and Half option (half soup/salad/sandwich).  Well, that is not what the menu says, but nevertheless I ordered a full salad.  At the cashier I asked if it was possible to order a half salad as stated on the menu board.  She said, hmm, I'm not sure, and looked at the cash register.  Then she said, yes, because it is on the register, I guess you can.  \n\n3.  The menu clearly states that you can substitute any meat with Grilled Tofu.  My friend ordered a salad and asked to substitute the chicken for tofu.  They salad guy said ""what?  Oh no, we don't have any of that.""  My friend pointed out what it says on the menu and he frantically ran around shouting ""Do we have tofu, do we have tofu?""  Nobody else knew what he was talking about so he came back and said ""no we don't have tofu.""  My friend again pointed out that the menu says they have it and he again asked a couple of people and said ""no sorry, I don't know why the menu says that."" The woman at the cash register confirmed that they do have tofu.\n\n4.  Cosi Card - they have a Cosi card which you can get if you ask for it.  I asked the cashier for it one day after my transaction and he gave me one.  I asked why he didn't ask if I had a card before my purchase and he said ""oh, we aren't trained to ask before a purchase.""  Dumb.  Dumb.  Also, why can't I use my phone # when I come back to get credit for my purchase.  Why do I physically have to carry my card around instead of being able to give my phone number like most rewards programs?\n\n5.  Tables dirty - usually\n\n6.  Agree with another review - they will have a guy rolling out bread when there are 10 people in line.  Shouldn't that be done during downtime?\n\n7.  They people behind the counter don't look up.  They'll stand there with a line of people seemingly not noticing that people are waiting to order.\n\nI could go on.  Unfortunately, we moved into the Bourse Building across from Cosi 4 months ago and Cosi is the closest place where I can get a decent salad so I and my co-workers go there more than we would like.  The food inside the Bourse Building is pretty bad.  \n\nThe food at Cosi is generally good, I just really wish they would get their act together Operationally.  It is a total joke the way this place is run.  Clown shoes.",1,dQFiETbHfM6wXXpNAFAzZQ

I've been to this location 2 times and both were for dinner.  First time I came here for dinner, I ordered the seared tuna, which I found to be not too bad.  My date had some steak dish, which was just ok, nothing impressive about it.  The drinks here I should comment are worth the money because they don't skimp you on the alcohol.  \n\nThe second time I came here, we started with the dumplings and scallops.  The dumplings were not at all tasty, the sauce was a little on the sour side for my taste. I personally don't like scallops, my date loves it.  I gave it a taste and it was meh; however the sauce that came with it was flavorful. We moved on to ordering the string fries which I found to be weird. Whoever came up with this dish did not stop to think how messy it would be to eat it.  It was literally a pile of fries shredded in strings.  The manager came around and asked us if we liked our food, we mentioned that we didn't like the fries so he did take it away and replaced it with another dish without charging us for the fries.  A+ for the service and accommodation to make you happy.  Of note for this place is the tuna tacos.  This dish was the best of the night (raw tuna with a type of vegetable as the ""tortilla"").  It is a cold dish, came with marinated tomatoes in balsamic vinaigrette.  I must mention that the tomatoes were SO DELICIOUS. I LOVED IT, we actually replaced the messy fries with another dish of tuna tacos.  Turned out that I ate most of the tomatoes on this dish as my date was complaining that he only got one of them on the second time around (YIKES!) LOL.\n\nOverall, this restaurant is just an OK restaurant compared to the availability offered in Philadelphia.

My wife wanted a white tablecloth experience, and they didn't disappoint one bit. We started, seated at an outside table which was in their tranquil  covered patio, however, it appears we were on the menu for the night because the mosquitoes were biting. They had one lonely citronella torch that wasn't getting the job done, so we ended up relocating to the inside about 5 minutes behind another party.  The decor was upscale but not in a stuffy way and the staff was friendly and attentive. We had tickets for a show at the Walnut Theater, around the corner for 7PM so our 5:30 reservation got us in and out just in time. We both opted for the pre-theater menu. For starters, she went with the kale salad and I had the heirloom tomato and mozzarella. Both were fantastic. My wife was looking forward to the peppercorn pasta however our server informed her that they were out of the pasta. The kitchen was able to re-create the dish with a different pasta and all was well. I opted for the short ribs. The meat was tender, however, it was a little on the bland side which was a downer. The chive puffs that came on the side were divine!  Both of our desserts were just ok. I had the coconut panna cotta. I'd never tried panna cotta before so I didn't quite know what to expect. I'm sure, in the world of panna cotta, it was outstanding, it just wasn't my thing. My wife had the lemon icebox cake. It was sweet and tart but again, neither of us were wowed. I'm sure it was more of a poor choice on our part than anything lacking from the kitchen.  I enjoyed two of their manhattan cocktails and they were the best (only) manhattan's I've ever had.

It's so good you're going to want to be a fatty and eat two (I'm guilty of having done this). \n\nI'm also a huge fan of their lychee raspberry Panna cotta. I can't express the exquisiteness of this dessert. The Panna cotta is light and airy with that airy citrusy taste of lychee which is just perfectly balanced with the tang of raspberry purée over the Panna cotta. \n\nThey also make a mean iced coffee and an even cooler milk foam tea which is very refreshing and tasty.\n\nIf you're in the mood for Asian style desserts and you happen to by in Center city, this is the place to go. I highly recommend it.\n\nAlso, they deliver via UberEats if you're feeling a little lazy and their service is top notch, the cashier is a complete sweetheart.

I moved closer to the Jefferson area, so I decided to try Panda Garden because of how close it is...and as a result, I got to experience the worst meal I've had in the city of Philadelphia to date.\n\nI can't say that the food was gross, or there was anything unhygienic about it. Simply put, I've grown accustomed to chinese food having actual flavor, and this place just didn't cut it. \n\nI got an order of General Tso's chicken (came with white rice) and an egg roll. First of all, the egg roll tasted like dirt! It was way overcooked, had practically nothing in it, and lacked any taste. Even when dipping it in duck sauce (don't you hate when Chinese restaurants are stingy about these sauce packets? I got a whole 2 packets...), the roll tasted horrible.\n\nGeneral Tso's chicken is my staple item when trying a new Chinese place, and for those who don't know its meant to be cooked on the spicier side. I guess the cook at Panda Garden didn't get that memo, because the chicken was about as bland and as boring as it could get. I ended up dumping a ton of Siracha (thank god for that stuff!) onto the chicken just so I could get some actual taste.\n\nI've been to plenty of places that offer great decor and friendly, tentative service, but for me it all comes down to the quality of the food. This is how I base the ratings I give restaurants, and for the most part I haven't been disappointed in that category. Panda Garden may have the nicest decor and the best service around (although I wouldn't know since I got take-out anyhow), but the food here straight up sucks! Do yourself a favor and head up a few blocks to Chinatown for much better Chinese food.\n\nOn a side note, I give them 2 stars (instead of 1) because of amusement factor: the person who rung me up when I got there was some kid who couldn't be older than like 12! He strolled up to the register with a juice box in one hand lol! But hey, he knew what I was there for and rung me up without any issues, so props to him",0,mTnlujPxGhxwlyPL4oXzrQ

I know it's a martini bar restaurant, and it's probably not fair to review its brunch experience. But, since it offers Sunday brunch, it is fair. So here goes:\n\nI'm usually a Stephen Starr fan. Buddakhan and Morimoto are two of our favorite Philly restaurants. Parc has an excellent lunch (and location to boot).  But Continental is a Starr aberration. It's just... bad. It has all the trappings of a Starr restaurant: retro and hip decor, trendy clientele, but the brunch food is boring and predictable. I've been here twice for Sunday brunch with my mother, husband and four kids. So we are a large party to please. But really, the kids just like french toast or pancakes, or anything they can dump syrup on, so brunch is a pretty easy meal to order.  \n\nThe brunch menu reads like that of just about any diner, and we ordered pretty typical brunch fare. My kids ordered the brioche French toast (served with caramel bananas), I had the nova on a bagel, my husband had oatmeal with raisins and granola, and my mother had the Big Bang (pancakes, bacon, sausage, eggs, home fries and toast).\n\nThe food presentation was boring, and the food was no better than IHOP's. Come to think of it, IHOP's pancakes are actually much better than the flapjacks that came with the Big Bang. The brioche French toast was a real disappointment. There was nothing original or flavorful about it. The best French toast with caramelized bananas we've ever had was at BrickTops in Naples, FL; Starr should just throw out his recipe and beg them to use theirs.\n\nI'm sure Continental is a fun place to meet friends for drinks, have a night out or stop in after a play (it's near the Arden Theatre), but save your money and go elsewhere for brunch.",2,vBFtIlBirAvgbTrxE6w30A

She was wonderful, patient, and courteous; she gave us menu suggestions when we were indecisive and even brought us out water.  \n\nI read reviews of this café before going in, so I was beyond excited to try the Green Tea-ramisu, which contains layers of matcha mascarpone cream and matcha sponge cake, which is then served with a scoop of salted caramel pretzel ice cream. \n\nThis is easily one of the most aesthetic desserts I've ever been served. The tiramisu part was served in a wooden box and the top was artfully covered with a drizzle of cream, two matcha filled biscuits, as well as a sprinkle of matcha powder and white chocolate curls. The ice cream was shaped into one of the most perfect spheres of ice cream I've ever seen and was sitting on a light bed of cookie crumbs. It was almost too beautiful to eat, but of course, my earlier inhibitions of destroying a work of food art were completely diminished after I took the first bite. \n\nAs you can imagine, it tasted as good as it looked - it was a delightful experience. The tiramisu was so airy and there was just the right amount of green tea flavor; as you can tell, I love matcha, so a lot of green tea flavor is needed to keep me satisfied. The ice cream was heavenly as well. I normally don't enjoy salted caramel desserts, but the taste of the salt was so light that it was simply divine - the texture was perfectly complemented by the crunchy pretzel pieces and the cookie crumbs. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend A La Mousse - its desserts are delicious, exquisite, and a must-try for all matcha fanatics.",0,_vGQPhW5kicPMYhA8ebJxQ

I don't know how long it's been open so maybe they will eventually spruce it up a bit.  The place seemed clean enough and that is always good.  You order at the counter and they bring it to you.  You clean your table up after you're finished.\nAs I wrote,  the spicy Ramen was my pick.  I really liked the broth of the soup.  It was spicy and flavorful, seemed well balance, for me anyway.  You can get a large or small bowl.  What I didn't like was that there is basically no substance.  You get a few thinly sliced pieces of pork belly (was good-did I say thin?), and a few other small tidbits along with your noodles.  I had the large bowl which was only filled a hair above halfway.  \nNow, I'm not cheap but I do expect a fair trade for my dollar.  The large bowl was $11.00 and could've been had at a Viet Pho shop (comparable)  for $6.95.  For that reason I doubt I will go back.  I like good food at a fair price.  They have good Ramen but it's too expensive for what you get.  It's Ramen.\nI really wish the place well.  I don't know whose shop it is but I would venture to say it is the guys working there.

There is nothing available that is not pork based, except for the canned beverages.\n\nSecondly, I'm a bit of a ramen snob. Not that I eat at the best ramen places, but it is probably among my favorite foods and I've been to a many of places, but my favorite is still at Mitsuwa in edgewater, NJ. I've been to momofuku and other places in NYU, but I still hold mitsuwa as the standard. \n\nThat being said, it is probably the best low price point ramen in town. I haven't had morimoto's or raw's, but both are probably more expensive?\n\nI ordered a small shoyu ramen and a the pork belly sides. And the service was pretty quick. Granted there was no one else in line with me, there were about 4 tables full, but everyone had received their food. I got my order in about 3 or 4 minutes. I wasn't timing them, but I almost finished 1 game of scramble with 2 time extension boosts, before my name was called. \n\nPork belly is hard to do. Momofuku does it perfect. Nom nom, does it pretty well. For $5.56 (or some weird price point where it sums to $14 with a small ramen) you get a plate with 2 small pork belly buns. The pork buns have lettuce, cucumber, hoisin sauce, spicy mayo, and pork belly. As a whole, it was pretty delicious. The sauces were a great compliment, but I couldn't tell how the pork belly was cooked. The reason I bring this up is because I really enjoyed the bun, but when I had the ramen, the pork ended up being a tad over cooked. If you don't mind paying nearly $2.75 for a small pork bun, I would indulge, but it's not a great value for the portion you get.\n\nNow the ramen itself. I'm a huge fan of shoyu ramen (soy broth). The broth was well done and flavorful. A bit salty, but not enough to really bother me. The pork was a bit over cooked. It was fatty, but I expected it to be less tough considering it comes in broth. The noodles were ... okay. I'm not a fan of firmer ramen noodles. It's not like they were under or over cooked or anything and I've been to many ramen stores that prefer the firmer noodles, but like I said earlier, I measure it on a scale of 1 to mitsuwa and Mitsuwa has very tender hand made noodles. These were simply too firm for my taste. The other stuff goodies in the bowl were a bit sparse and I think maybe I had 2 slices of pork, 3 at the most. For $1.7whatever I would definitely add an additional pork and maybe an egg, which would bring the price of a small to about an even $10. \n\nI would definitely go back because there is no adequate ramen in the city, maybe I need to check raw, but as far as I know this is probably one of the best in Philly. Definitely near the top of the list, but the list is very very short.",0,KXYRjdlgg-Gw7mwF22ZAJg

We were picking out which lamps were our favorites.\n\nSince we had a large group, they had us do a fixed price menu. We had chips/salsa/guac, chayote salad, veggie quesadillas, chicken tacos, and beef short rib enchiladas, and rice/refried beans as sides. Everything was very good and fresh! I think the chicken tacos were my favorite and the salad was really good too. \n\nOnly thing I didn't really like is how they brought the main food out in shifts. It was just the quesadillas first. When we were done those, then they brought the tacos. When done those, then they brought the rice/beans, and finally the enchiladas. I would've liked to have things more together, especially since the rice/beans were a side dish and we didn't even get them until we were almost done with everything.\n\nOverall, it was a decent experience, but not absolutely spectacular.",0,fa8NWW6_UjyvMWPg90C1yA

The roll was fresh, soft but a bit too chewy for my preference and the steak contained significant gristle.  This should never happen with your signature item.

We were staying in the City Hall area of Philadelphia and we took a cab to the Continental for $5. From the outside, we thought that it was going to be a greasy spoon-style diner, but it's definitely not. It seemed like a hipster place, but we weren't out-of-place in jeans and sneakers either. \n\nWe went inside (it seemed really hot indoors, blech) and were told it'd be at least 15 minutes for a table. We waited outside and said we'd walk around and see if we could find someplace else to eat ... however, we then spotted the Continental's outdoor tables. Since it was a nice night, we asked the hostess if there was a wait to sit outside, and she said no and immediately seated us. A waiter came over within a couple minutes and took our drinks orders. I got wine and my husband got beer - their cocktail menu seemed a bit pricey. \n\nThe waiter told us that the menu is ""tapas-style"" - the food doesn't come in huge portions, and each dish is brought out as it's ready rather than all at once, and it's intended to be shared. I asked for the New York strip steak and my husband requested the lobster macaroni and cheese, and we said to each other that we'd order another dish or two if that didn't turn out to be enough. \n\nIt turned out to be plenty. The lobster mac came out first ... I was initially hesitant to share that, since I'm not a seafood fan, but it was very tasty and not fishy at all. The macaroni was actually orzo noodles in a creamy sauce, the lobster was sprinkled throughout the dish in small chunks, and there was a nice crispy breadcrumb topping. The steak was brought out to us a couple minutes later ... it came in several thin slices, it was cooked to order and it was accompanied by fingerling potatoes and mushrooms in a very yummy red wine reduction sauce. \n\nWe opted out of getting dessert here, figuring that there must be a cafe or bakery nearby where we could get some coffee and a sweet. We walked around the neighborhood and found nothing (except for the Franklin Fountain ice cream parlor, but we had been there after lunch the same day so we didn't want the same thing). We ended up heading back to the hotel without dessert. \n\nEverything was very good here, but the Continental is definitely charging for the ambiance and the retro theme.

One of the reasons is that I absolutely love meat. It tastes good, it's filling, it makes my tummy smile and it pairs well with the nice happy smile it puts on my face. As for being a vegan, um, I'm sorry but, no cheese? Whatever you are smokin that makes this okay in your mind, um, keep that pass to yourself. \n\nFinally there are meals like the one I had yesterday at Sonny's Famous Steaks. Since we hired a Philly CM, my main mission was to get my butt out here and have an authentic Philly Cheese steak. Of course that is a terribly touristy thing to say and yearn for, but oh well Judgmental John, but I love hot meat, gooey cheese and hot meat and gooey cheese that fuses flawlessly to a roll and bada bing bada boom, that's what Sonny's delivers best.\n\nNow this story can't even continue without mentioning the sassy and sarcastic stylings of Kevin. The main guy working the counter here that had so much ""Clerks"" attitude that I couldn't help but fall for him. You can tell that he deals with a boat-load of ""Me's;"" the tourists on the quest for the PCS, but even in spite of that, he talked us through it and delivered us to a yummy happy place...and hey, at least we didn't go total tourist and hit up Pat's or Geno's. Shiiit, even I know better than that.\n\nAnyhoo let's just talk a little more about these sammiches. For starters they use Cheese Wiz. Now apparently, some people on this planet have a problem with this. Again, what are you smoking? That can of orangeish-yellowish chemicals is a God-send. Try eating some infused in a hot dog, it's magical.\n\nNext was the drip down the arm factor. A true measure of a great sammich in my book. If I don't use my sleeves as napkins and go through about 15 of the paper ones, eff that, you failed me as a sammich. Finally there was the total meat juicy cheesy mess that was left on the paper below the sammich. Oh man, it was love.\n\nI don't think I will ever be able to eat another Philly Cheese steak now. And how can I? This was junk food perfection. And provolone?! You can keep your stinkin provolone, cuz I'm gettin cheesy with the Cheese Wiz, yo!",8,B7ecAeAIrXg7sgmabS38pg

It's funny how you can live in a city for 3+ years and walk past a place almost every single week --- a place that you assume is just another tourist staple in Old City.

It looks just like the rest of the historical tourist attractions in Old City, with its huge pillars and what have you. But alas, thanks to the magical ability that my sister has of paying attention to her surroundings... and frequenting Happy Hours...

The bartender flat out ignored us most of the time even though we were sitting directly in front of her. We sat with empty drinks trying to get her attention through our entire visit and it was super frustrating. I overheard her talking to a server about how she was moving or leaving the restaurant so it was clear that she was already mentally checked out at that point. When we were splitting the bill, one person had cash and the other 2 of us had cards and we had just miscalculated the amount on something I think.

I was going to have her re-run my card but she immediately stormed off not to be seen again. I don't know if she thought we were trying to short her but we definitely weren't, it was just a miscalculation on our part. We left the money that she had thrown at my friend which she shouldn't have given change for anyway. For what it's worth, I still tipped 20+% as I always do even with the attitude we got from her. \n\nI'll stick to my Continental Mid-Town location, no reason to go back to this one.",3,fa8NWW6_UjyvMWPg90C1yA

We were seated in the outdoor area. it was a really cute space that looks like a garden, but also more chilly. I had to request that they turn on the heaters after about 10 min. We ordered the wild mushroom arancini, spaghetti and meatballs, and the pan seared gnocchi. We asked the waitress, who verified that all of those dishes were favorites and delicious. The arancini was overly heavy. It did have a nice crunch, but not much flavor. The spaghetti and meatballs were also lacking in flavor. The meatballs were lacking spice and the marinara sauce tasted bland - like plain tomato sauce. Lastly, the gnocchi was ok. I had previously tasted the gnocchi from Barbuzzo which was amazing, tasty, and very soft so I was hopeful of this dish. The tomatoes, corn, and other toppings did not seem to come together - it tasted like it was all just thrown in, but remained separate entities. The gnocchi itself was ok, but not amazing. The waitress was nice, but service did not stand out compared to other restaurants. Would I return? Probably not.

I will note that I enjoy spicy food however I did not enjoy the ""hot sauce"" they add to make a dish spicy.  It's unnecessarily hot to the max.  It's to the point where it overpowers the ingredients and doesn't allow you to truly enjoy the dish.  I would suggest a medium spicy sauce to add if you want some heat while also keeping your taste buds in tact and functional in the falafel.  I can only get to Mama's occasionally so in the interim I forget to skip the spice and once I'm home and bite into the sandwich it all comes back and I'm slightly agitated that I can't fully enjoy the food. I would even be thankful if a note or mention to the customer was given that the spicy sauce is extremely spicy.

It was a Saturday evening and we didn't have a reservation (sue me) but the hostess found us a table for two. When we sat down, the chair sagged a bit too much so that I was uncomfortably shorter than the table. She immediately found a comfortable pillow that propped me up just fine. \n\nThen along came Ken, our waiter, who was courteous, attentive, professional, and a wealth of knowledge about the menu and the wine selection. We went with his wine recommendation and it was glorious - tantalizing bouquet, just the right amount of oakiness, good legs. We ordered the eggplant caponata with burrata for our appetizer. Delectable, especially with the fresh bread. For my entree I ordered Pappardelle Al Ragu Aquilano. There was no problem switching out the ribbon pasta for spaghetti. My friend had the Agnoletti Al Tartufo with a savory black and white truffle gelato. To both our surprise, the gelato was an excellent pairing with the raviolo. If you want to try something different, go with that.\n\nAlthough the restaurant was busy, we were never rushed through our meal. One of the owners stopped by to check that we were happy (I guess the grins weren't enough.) Ken kept an eye on us, bringing water, extra napkins, bread, and anything else we needed.\n\nWhen it came time for Dolci (dessert) it was a no brainer. GELATO! The only problem was choosing the flavor. I enjoyed every bit of Desire (it was heaven) while my friend was mesmerized by Nocciola and Creme Caramel.\n\nEven though we had a variety of food and wine, we did not leave the restaurant feeling bloated, as happens in so many Italian restaurants. The portions were reasonable and not the mountain of pasta you get elsewhere. \n\nI was highly pleased and would absolutely recommend to anyone looking for an excellent meal.",2,8vUxzLiEHmTPzvAJ3a4-Cw

SPB was originally a cart in South Philly, then moved into what is now the Mike's BBQ space on S. 11th (another great spot!), and finally merged with El Compadre on S. 9th, a restaurant owned by Chef Christina Martinez's son (who sadly passed away). [Note: They are thinking about moving again.]\n\nRecently, I've really gotten into making my own corn tortilla at home, guided by Alex Stupak & Jordan Rothman's excellent book, ""TACOS: Recipes and Provocations.""  They make the point over and over again that there is a distinct hierarchy in corn tortillas (more so than flour): Fresh-made corn masa is much better than store bought; and fresh-made tortillas that have never been permitted to cool down (there is some interesting starch science involved) are much better than cold tortillas that have been reheated (and certainly the mass produced ones you buy in the store).  I can't independently verify all that, since I haven't tried to make my own masa, but I am convinced fresh-made tortillas are the way to go.\n\nWhich brings us to EL COMPADRE, which is apparently the ONLY taqueria in Philly that makes their own corn tortillas completely from SCRATCH, going so far as to raise their own heritage Mexican varieties of corn at Culton Organic in Silver Spring PA (and excellent farm that I have visited).  Here's a great video with all the fascinating details:\n\nhttp://www.pocho.com/nixtamalization-means-fresh-tortillas-at-south-philly-barbacoa-video/\n\nEl Compadre is a small storefront, smack dab in the middle of Philly's wonderfully old-school, outdoor Italian Market area.  Out front, you will see a few tightly squeezed communal sidewalk tables under an awning, and the interior is no bigger.  Go inside, order your choice of two tacos (their signature lamb barbacoa, and chorizo were available the day I was there), grab a seat at the communal tables, and a waiter will bring you your tacos, a drink, and soup if you want (I didn't try the latter), and dig in.  Oops, you will have to get up again, since there are some toppings on a table along the side, and you don't want to miss those!  Especially the excellent guacamole (heap on as much as you like on your taco, rather than the tiny dish that most places give you).\n\nI lived in Philly for 5 years before moving back to Boston, and I saw many stories about the original South Philly Barbacoa (they also get a lot of press due to their involvement in discussions about immigration into the US), but never made it here for some reason.  Now that I've grown to love tacos...\n\n...I REALLY REGRET THAT NOW THAT I LIVE IN BOSTON AND CAN'T EAT HERE EVERY DAY!!!\n\nJust Eat It!",19,xc1opNkFCnAjsPXs7jqtfg

On the other hand, our server was attentive and polite and apologized several times for the kitchen moving so slowly at the beginning of a weeknight dinner service with fewer than 6 tables seated in the entire house. My drink was good. What was it? Can't remember. The outdoor eating space could use some fumigating or at least preventative methods for the mosquitoes, we moved inside after that realization. I skipped dessert because my duck leg quarter was so sad I had to send it back completely and just have a salad. It looked like it could've been wonderful if the gorgeous crispy skin someone worked so hard to achieve hadn't been bogged down by the cooking liquid of the undercooked wild rice and a moist fresh scallion garnish right on top. All in all, I honestly want to believe the kitchen was just not working in sync that night and on a night when they are the food must be great.

The next dish was the Frito misto which was fried calamari, shrimp and zucchini. It was ok and not the best dish of the night. We then ordered the Carbonara with a bacon gelato pairing.

That was the PERFECT comment. No, you tourists do not know how good you have it if you happen to pick Sonny's for your first try at a cheesesteak. You are dang lucky!\n\nI have lived in Philly most of my life, and have eaten HUNDREDS of cheesesteaks. So if you choose to benefit from my life's experience, KNOW that Sonny's is tops in and out of Philly. They are second to none, but fast on their heels is, believe it or not, a little-known place in the burbs (Westtown Meat Market), who, by far, makes the best cheesesteak in the suburbs.\n\nMy husband and I made a trip downtown specifically to try Sonny's. We got a Sonny's cheesesteak and a Campo's cheesesteak at the same time; we each ate half of each one. No comparison. Once I got Sonny's into my mouth I could have thrown Campo's on the street. I had NO interest in another bite of Campo's once I had Sonny's. The best!  Of course, that is not the limit of my comparisons, but I don't want to bore you with details. I do not believe I have called any other cheesesteak on Yelp THE BEST IN ALL OF PHILLY. No, just Sonny's.\n\nAs many have said, lines are awful. Even in winter (and I mean late February when it is record cold, not Xmas time), and even at 2-to-4pm at that awkward interval between lunch and dinner, there are still long enough lines.

Here is my concise argument for why Sonny's is better than Pat's or Geno's or most other spots.  \n\n1.) The roll is great, soft but just crusty enough, and smaller than the others.\n2.) Just so we're clear, I like my cheesesteak with whiz and fried onions.... Pat's and Geno's are assembly lines, that crank hundred and even thousands of cheesesteaks a day,  they slop the whiz on and slop inconsistent amounts of meat, sometimes this works out in your favor, and sometimes its a huge mess.\n3.) Lines, ALWAYS a line down there, Sonny's, I can walk to from work and have a minimal wait.\n4.) Whenever I got to Pat's I feel like I need like 20 showers to get rid of the grease, Sonny's, not as messy, or greasy....\n5.) Because it's less messy, it's less of a guilt trip, and as a 28 year old woman with hopes for keeping my figure while I can, it allows me to keep a cheesesteak on my semi-regular lunch rotation without tremendous amounts of guilt and extra trips to the gym. \n6.) Climate Controlled (indoors) I mean no one feels like a cheesesteak on a 100 degree day and I've also been after a birds game in 0 degree weather, neither are awesome. Sonny's is inside!\n7.) Sonny's is cheaper, it's like a $7 cheesesteak vs a $9-11 cheesesteak (i can't even remember what it is at this point)\n\nPlease do not get me wrong, I LOVE Pats and will eat most any cheesesteak...and the whole experience is really the best part of it, But if you eat cheesesteaks with any consistency and want to avoid the crowds and excess mess, Sonny's is the real deal.\n\nThat is all!",1,nn7aw-T8v1R4lNp3noRhnw

The first moment I plopped one of these dumplings in my mouth, they transformed into delicate angelic efferent pillows bursting with flavors that made me feel really guilty for loving them so much. Since we came here as a group, we ended up ordering a little bit of everything. My favorite was the cesar salad, with a very (heavy and creamy) delicious home made dressing and cake-consistency croutons. The chopped salad is definitely the cheaper and healthier option, but to be honest, I don't think it was that special. The arancini was good, basic, with appropriate (although over-use of) fancy truffle oil. For the avid meatball enthusiasts, I was not a big fan only because the meatball were really too salty for me to appreciate any other flavors. However, I will state that the creamy polenta was the highlight of that dish and I would gladly devour of a bowl or even tub of that super unhealthily delicious golden porridge. The mozzarella was good...but nothing crazy. The fig toast was ok, but didn't rock my socks off. The service was quite excellent overall and on a nice day, the backyard open seating is very pretty.

This is my first time coming across such creativity here in the states. Usually these type of desserts are found in Asia! Super points for all the creativity in their cake design and flavors. \n\nI was highly intrigued by the LINE friends dessert since I am such a huge fan!! The Sally cake is a passion fruit mousse with a mango yogurt cream Center. This combination sounded sooo good but it was wayyy too sweet!! The yogurt cream had more of a subtle tart and sweetness to it - which was just the perfect fluffy texture. However, the mango bits in the yogurt cream was the part that contributed to the overly sweet cake. I hope they can tone down the sweetness a bit. \n\nThe Le Violet Cake was very intriguing as well. It's a black currant mousse with pistachio center. I highly enjoyed this dessert - great flavors! The pistachio center was almost ice cream like. \n\nThe matcha chai latte was something new for me - it was nice and smooth and I could tell the matcha was decent quality.

You pick a pizza dough, make your way down an assembly line adding toppings (there are a lot of choices and they're of excellent quality), and then watch them put it through their magically-quick oven, then you get your personal pizza, pay, and you're on your way.  The first time I went, I found it hard to believe that it could come out of the oven in a minute with good crust, cheese that was melted but not burned, etc.  But it does, and the pizza is delicious.  The selection of doughs, sauces and toppings also allows you to make a huge variety of ""pizzas,"" including some that resemble traditional pizza only in having crust and toppings.  And they can accommodate vegan and gluten free diets, so there's something for everyone.\n\nThey also have some really good ""craft"" sodas and good teas.\n\nAnd the prices are fair...

The food melted in my mouth and even my husband, who ordered the Chinese food and is usually not a big fan of Italian food admitted that it was amazing and he wants to order it  with me the next time :) The mushroom aranchine were crunchy on the outside and flavorful with a nice mushroom flavor on the inside. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the combo of broccoli, pistachio sauce and pesto was to die for. By the time I was eating tiramisu I was in heaven.

The price isn't terrible, and the portions are super generous and fed us for another whole meal. \n\nWe ordered the sweet and sour chicken, sesame chicken, walnut shrimp, and Szechuan style pork along with an appetizer of two egg rolls and crab wontons.  The sesame chicken and the walnut shrimp were my two personal faves, and they really packed the takeout container with a ton of meat rather than filling it up with filler veggies. Everything tasted delicious and as expected, and really hit the spot for fulfilling our takeout craving. The order came with two generous portions of white rice, and we weren't charged extra for it.\n\nThe only two downsides to the meal were that the dipping sauce with the sweet and source pork was super watered down for some reason?

I saw some really great reviews and the more I read, the more I saw Genos and Pat's being called ""overrated"". We were fortunate enough that despite going on a Saturday early evening, there was no line. The seating there is pretty limited to 2 four seater tables outside, a few bar like tables in the front on the inside and some cafeteria like tables in the back. We got a cheesesteak, a chickensteak and some french fries. The sandwiches were great. Great quality meat and the bread was perfect. The french fries were very plain and I would advise again it unless you have it topped with cheese or something. A basic Cheesesteak was $9 with the choice of a few free toppings including peppers and onions. I believe you can add premium toppings such as bacon for a dollar or two extra.\n\nA wonderful experience, the only complaint I have is the service was a bit slow. The people there are very informative and nice but just slow. There were only about 2 people ahead of me and from that time, it took about 10 minutes for me to order due to previous customer mix ups (not getting the right food) and just a lot of talking and joking with each other behind the counter instead of taking orders. Once ordered, it didn't take long for our order to be called. I usually try not to ""knock"" places on my reviews but this was definitely annoying and even the person in front of me made a comment about the pace of taking orders, especially when the place was pretty empty.\n\nIn the commotion of things, I noticed afterward that I had been charged additionally for a fountain drink, when then fountain machine was in fact broken so all drinks were bottles.\n\nThese complaints though, would never prevent me from returning. The food was more than worth it, just be prepared to wait, even though there isn't a line. And check your receipt :)",2,6S4uxbPpb9pMk9bKMUVZng

Sadly this was not the case.\n\nWe were seated at a little table by the window.  It was a Friday night, so the place was crowded.  The server said we should probably order one to two appetizers to share and a main course each.  I thought the linguini with clams sounded good.  I thought that surely the pasta must be homemade as this is supposed to be an Italian restaurant.  I asked just to be sure, and the server told me, ""No, it isn't, but the pasta is imported from Italy.""  This should have been a red flag.  I mean most dried pasta at the grocery store is imported from Italy.  Dried pasta tastes way different from fresh.  I should have just walked out at this point.  It is just sad when an Italian restaurant can't do that.  I can boil dried pasta at home easily and cheaply.  The reason I eat out is to try things that I can't do with either the time I have or the equipment I have available in my kitchen.\n\nWe ordered the beets with fresh cheese and herbs and the wild mushroom arancini which was risotto balls with buffalo mozerella.  The beets were just beets with a small amount of crumbled cheese and a couple tears off of a basil leaf.  I like beets, so they were good, but nothing I couldn't do at home quickly. \n\nThe risotto balls were a major disappointment.  The truffled aioli had no truffle flavor, and the inside of the balls were mushy and I didn't get any of the lovely creamy buffalo mozzarella flavor I was looking forward to tasting.  The outside was crispy, and that was the only thing this dish really had going for it.  \n\nMy main course was very disappointing.  It was very salty and the sauce just tasted like overly salty lemons.  The swordfish was full of tiny little sharp bones in every bite which made it not so fun to eat.  The shaved fennel on top added some nice texture, but that was really all it had going for it.  For $22, I was disappointed.\n\nOn a positive note, the server was friendly, and we always had plenty of water.  I feel that Little Nonna's needs to step up their game as there are many Italian American joints in town with a lower price point that are just as good or better.  Our total was around $78 with tax and tip for two people, and we only had water and no dessert.  At this price point, you should be making your own pasta and making sure you aren't serving filets of seafood that are full of tiny bones.",2,NMOxipsnXc6olWdHYzXiYA

It's a really cute cafe with good service; you step in and can order at the counter to go or wait at a table for a menu to be brought to you.

Matcha latte\n4/5\nPretty basic but it was excellently made. Not too sweet and the foam on top was not too thick either. This was recommended to us as their most popular hot drink.\n\n2. Lychee Panna Cotta\n3/5\nThis dessert was just average compared to the others that we ordered since there wasn't anything too special about it. \n\n3. Green Tea-ra-misu\n3.5/5\nMuch creamier than I expected and there wasn't much ""cake"" to it--it mostly consisted of cream. Strong matcha flavor in the whipped cream though!\n\n4. Baked matcha cheesecake\n4/5\nWell made cheesecake but if you're looking for something a little bit more unique, I recommend ordering the two items below. \n\n5. Sizzling ice cream\n5/5\nThis item comes out in a sizzling pan and you pour the matcha sauce on top of the ice cream and brownie. You watch as the matcha sauce bubbles in the pan and then dive into the brownie and ice cream which are warm. I think this is a really unique dessert that you don't commonly get to try.\n\n6. Japanese mille crepe cake\n5/5\nIf you like whipped cream with fruit, you'll love this crepe cake because that's literally all it has in between the layers of crepe.

The first time was a summer happy hour, which was when I tried the Gran Gianduiotto Gran Caffe L'Aquilla/Levante stout, which might just be my favorite stout beer ever. (It's dessert-y but not cloyingly so - if you're a stout fan, do yourself a favor and get it). The ambiance was very nice, my party being seated towards the back of the first floor, where it was extra bustling with servers flying to and fro carrying platters of food and drink (sometimes to us, but mostly we were kind of in their way which I felt bad about, especially because they were so nice about it). The wine selection was tempting, but I'm a one drink-per happy hour girl (at least these days). The prices are what you would expect for a nice Italian restaurant kind of experience, but the quality definitely lives up to them, so very worth it.\nToday's visit was for the office holiday party. Same location, same bustle. This time I partook of the food though, and I was very glad I did because everything I ate was completely delicious. The eggplant caponata bruschetta was as perfect, cooked just right and full of flavor, and the and tomato basil bruschetta was served with burrata mozzarella, the combination of which was so good I had to stop myself from going after the plates of my distracted colleagues. Being in the mood for a lighter drink, I had a glass of prosecco this time, and it was crisp and refreshing without screaming summer - a good sparkling wine for the winter too (although at 55 degrees today, what kind of winter is this?)\nThe food and drinks are all great, but I must acknowledge a truly personable and thoughtful waitstaff as well. As a vegetarian, I wasn't able to indulge in the meatier dishes offered, but I was pretty darn happy with my decadent bread and cheese (and those sinfully seasoned tomatoes). But one server in particular went above and beyond, bringing out dishes of sauteed mushrooms, broccoli rabe and asparagus, JUST for me and my other vegetarian colleagues (I think there are two).

I didn't know there are now multiple locations, but I shouldn't be surprised.  The artistry with the desserts is impeccable!  A friend from NYC told me that if there is a place like this, the average dessert would be at least $15-20 easily.  Prices are reasonable for what you get.  This is a good place to go for drinks- tea or coffee or other, or dessert.  I didn't know this place sold baguettes in some places, but I wouldn't recommend this place for baguettes in particular as one reviewer said they are expensive.  I'm sure it is good, but you want to save your stomach here for the drinks or the dessert.\n\nThe bourbon coffee I had was good, but it didn't stand out for me.  The milk foam rose tea has a slightly ""bitter"" taste with the sweet, but it worked!  I love ""experimental"" things like this that work.  It's still as beautiful as all their other selections.\n\nI also got to sample a tangerine cheesecake dessert.  The Orange on it looked like a real orange from the picture and at quick glance.  It is white chocolate on the outside with a cheesecake on the inside.  Seems like it would've taken a bit to make that.  Wow!\n\nA must-visit if you're in the area.",0,WaX5rCOD6UFIPHALwugTHw

Even though they make other dishes, you mainly want to order the 麻辣香锅 (dry spicy pot) or 麻辣烫 (ma la soup). They are both make-your-own so once you decide if you want it dry or with broth, you can choose which items you want because you will pay per item. If I had to choose between the two, I would choose the ma la soup because I like how their broth is milky like a ramen bone broth compared to the more traditional clearer spicy broth. Because these dishes are traditionally spicy, I would recommend opting to add a bit of spice. I can usually handle a 3/10 so I was pretty comfortable with mild. \n\nFood and Drink Ordered:\n* worth trying\n\n- [Dry Spicy Pot*]: Some may say that this tastes greasy but it's really those good Sichuan oils. I will say though that a drier, ""more fried"" spicy pot (like the one at Magic Pot but sadly they're closed ) tastes comparatively better. \n\n- [Ma La Soup*]: I HIGHLY recommend choosing instant noodles to add to the soup with whatever else you decide to add. \n \nWould I go back? : Yes, I've already gone back a few times. The only reason why I didn't give a 5 star is because I've had better dry spicy pot but I do like how their ma la soup is different from what I've had before.",4,MBW3ISBQ4RPX0e8gLtXSrg

We all got pasta. It was very yummy and cooked perfectly. The servers were very accommodating to my niece who doesn't like red sauce on her pasta. They did buttered spaghetti for her with the meatballs ON the side to avoid sauce touching the spaghetti. So kind. The lamb Ragu was very good and flavorful. I love a good restaurant quality lamb. I never eat it at home but it was to die for. The penne alle vodka was also INSANELY good with yummy spicy sausage making it the perfect dish. We got cannoli for dessert. Also good.

Impressively, they were all delicious (maybe we were just lucky...).\n\nFor starters, we tried the arancini and the bruschetta.  The mushroom arancini were freshly fried (and, thus, hot with a crispy crust) and served with cheese shavings and some (literally) awesome sauce.  It was difficult to divvy up the last of four balls into three even pieces, but we somehow managed.  The flavorfull bruschetta had a healthy dollop of beets, other veggies, and more.\n\nWe then got a trio of entrees.  The shortrib sandwich included a fair helping of succulent beef inside a fresh, crisp on the outside, bakery roll and came with a salad of non-iceberg-lettuce greens and more cheese shavings.  The eggplant parmigiana was just the right amount of crispy, cheesy, and tomato-saucy and accompanied by fresh greens.  And the wild mushroom gnocchi had its own different awesome sauce.  We almost licked the plates clean.\n\nFor dessert, we sampled the tiramisu, which arrives in a fancy teacup and is presented a bit like an ice cream sundae.  Its rich zabaglione cream soaking the cake ensured its complete consumption.\n\nThe drink selection is not large, but has fine options, like the Moretti lager, and various wines and cocktails.\n\nOur server was polite and professional and regularly refilled our water glasses.\n\nThe decor might be described as cool basement party.

The hostess was friendly and seated us quickly even though we were a bit early. \n\nOur waitress on the other hand was the complete opposite. She seemed to be in a mood. Like would rather of been anywhere else. What irritated me was that she never came to check on us. Just took our order brought the food. Cleared the plates and dropped the check. Barely spoke. \n\nWhen we asked about drink recommendations and clarification the information and descriptions she provided were far from accurate. I was going to order the scroppino but when I asked her about it she told me it's really more of a dessert than a drink. Very sweet and mostly sorbet. Not true. I ended up holding off on ordering one until after my meal and it was not sweet at all. Yes it has sorbet in it but the ratio of alcohol to sorbet is definitely heavier on the alcohol side. It was very strong! You don't even need a spoon or anything to eat it. The small scoop of sorbet in the middle melts pretty quick. Also the menu said blackberry sorbet. The sorbet in my drink was definitely not blackberry. Thank god I don't have any food allergies but it would have been nice if she told me it was being substituted. I think it had some kind of citrus sorbet instead. I never got a chance to ask because she just dropped the food and walked off and I really didn't want to make a big deal about it. \n\nFor the rest of our food we started with the meatballs. Average. Nothing to rave about. Very heavy on the cheese. Could have used a little more sauce. \n\nFor entrees I got the lobster fra diavolo. I was quite disappointed by this. The only lobster in the dish is the half tail they garnish it with on top. They don't even give you a full lobster tail and it's a pretty pricey dish. The rest is just a plate of pasta with pretty bland sauce. Nothing out the ordinary. Tasted like it could have been from a jar. \n\nMy friend ordered the rigatoni alla vodka.

Yes, you must pay even on a Sunday).\n\nThe food was simply bland, dry, and a tad unedible. And I am not saying this because I already have a breakfast place I am loyal to.

I was amazed -how can you mess up a breakfast sandwich? The eggs were not fluffy, and they added some weird herb to it to give it an ""off"" taste. There were two small pieces of bacon, and barely any cheese on it. All together, I'd rate a 1.\n\nMy date got the beet, cheese, onion omelet. It came with homefries, with his were in need of some serious seasoning, and wheat toast, which was literally was like eating grains. He did enjoy his coffee though. Coffee situation was odd though.

Among the other diners, one got the breakfast pizza, another got the stuffed french toast, and another got the sticky bun.  They were all really pleased.\n3. Hot sauce choices (including Sriracha and Tabasco)\n4. Yummy, moist carrot cake\n5. Pay at the counter -- I actually LOVE pay-at-the-counter for two major reasons: they are willing to split the check; it's fast.  However, when my friends and I went to pay at the counter, it was a slightly different story.  Read more about that below.\n\nSome things I didn't like:\n1. Not good for groups -- We were a party of 6 and they sat us at what had been a table for 4.  While I didn't mind being squeezed in with people, I know some of the bigger people at our table did.  Plus, the tables were uneven, i.e. one table was a couple of inches higher than the other, and I was sitting in the crack of the two tables.  My Eggs Benny, though delicious, were served on a rectangular plate, so I had a really hard time eating b/c of the hugely uneven tables.\n2. Customer favoritism -- As I say above, I love pay-at-the-counter, but even though my friends and I were waiting in line to pay, some guy who had ordered take-out came in and was allowed to butt in front of us, seemingly because he was friends with the cashier.  This seems like a small thing, but after waiting in a long line to pay, it was majorly insulting to be shown that if you know the cashier, you don't have to wait in line AND you can get in front of other customers.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend trying this place, but beware of certain non-food-related things that come off as customer-unfriendly.",1,FkaBNfCc2dRyQ2qXhsXXtg

Once you sit down, you are presented with a bottle of water for your table and a roll of paper towels (which, if you are doing things properly, will probably need). Your BBQ adventure starts of with an amuse bouche of saltine crackers and pimento cheese spread. A yummy way to get your taste buds moving. You would be remiss not to start off with an appetizer of the turkey tails, or my favorite, the biscuit basket with delicious green tomato jam. As far as the main entrees, you really can't go wrong here with the meat platters but my favorites are the brisket, all moist and juicy, and the succulent, smoky ribs that are full of flavor. I enjoy most of the sides, especially the beans, the collard greens, and the potato salad, but if you are new in town, by all means order the Lockhart. It's the way to go because you get brisket, chicken, and ribs, along with collard greens, cole slaw, baked beans, and potato salad. Don't worry if you can't eat it all because Percy Street will package it up nicely for you to take hime and they will throw in containers of their three different BBQ sauces. And make sure to save room for dessert because the key lime and pecan pies are the best in town, or for that matter, possibly anywhere else.",3,B9iPTih0dmpZn6fRyZnLLg

Honestly, they were nothing special - I did not like them but my sister did like them. Take that as you will! The shell of the biscuit were harder than ideal and tasted over cook. The biscuit tasted a bit dry - maybe they cooked the biscuits with too little butter. Not sure but the texture was just poor. The jam was a gooseberry jam which wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, but I felt like cheese spread for the complementary saltine crackers paired better with the biscuits than the jam. \n\nWe ordered: pulled pork sandwich with cornbread and 1/2 lb pork rack of ribs with French fries. \n\nPulled pork: This was pretty good and I would recommend the dish. The pulled pork had a savory tasted but was perfectly balanced with a hint of sweetness. The pork was dried out nicely and had a clear sauce to add more flavor to it. The coleslaw didn't have too much mayo and paired perfectly with the pork. However, I wouldn't even bother asking for the bun wth the sandwich. It's a cheap potato bun that wasn't able to hold the meat, slaw and pulled pork sauce. I would recommend this order without the bun.\n\nFrench fries: this is a great side to go with! The fries weren't cut super thin and have an excellent crispness to them. The fries are sprinkled with some bbq salt and give the fries a nice bang!\n\nCornbread in small cast iron: whack. My little sister who loves cornbread and gets it everywhere she goes, disliked it. The cornbread was dry and didn't taste like much. The texture was also overly crumbly.\n\nPork ribs: smelled super delicious but to our surprise, they weren't very yummy. The meat did not fall off the ribs very easily. As a matter of fact, my little sister and I had a hard time chewing the meat. Not sure if it was overcooked or something but for a bbq place, this was so disappointing.\n\nOverall, I would not come back to this place.

Not, like, all the tables were full, because there is NO SEATING. You have to get your salad and then get out!

Once we saw it, we both threw our ridiculously OVER-PRICED salads in the trash. We also felt ripped-off price-wise because it was FOUR DOLLARS to add FIVE OR SIX TINY pieces of shrimp to my girlfriend's salad.

It's a Chipotle-esque menu and where the customer can pick and choose what they want in their sushi burrito baby. Very fresh toppings. Definitely opt for the green papaya salad as one of your toppings. \n\nIn many ways, this is a glorified bigger sized sushi roll that isn't cut up into 6 or 8 pieces. Or a really big hand roll.

When we finally sat down, the manager comped us cans of beer and two bottles of wine.

I had read some press that mentioned Lockhart, TX (a town near Luling) was home to one of their favorite bbq places so I knew they had done their homework.  The menu is simple -- meats by 1/2 and full pound, sides available in both small and large, and big jugs o' beer.  \n\nA quick glance at the menu showed that all of the meats came with pickles, onion and white bread!  Oh yeah!  When we told the waiter that we were from Texas, he asked us if the menu looked like appealing -- to which my husband replied, ""Well, does it come out on butcher paper?"" And when our waiter said yes, we knew we were in for a good night.\n\nMy husband had the Yards root beer (tasty!) and I ordered the Manhattan, TX (recommended by our waiter) and it was great - whiskey, bitters, and they rinse the inside of the glass with Campari.  We ordered a 1/2 pound each of brisket (moist or lean, we went with the moist) and pork belly.  Sauce on the side so you can actually TASTE the meat.  For sides, we chose the mashed potatoes, collard greens and green beans.  All were delicious and needed no additional seasoning (and I make some mean collard greens!).   The only side I might add is some jalapeno cornbread (but that's not a biggie, I just miss it).\n\nDesserts are simple and homemade -- like apple crisp and pecan pie - and we decided to sample the banana pudding.  Fresh bananas, couple of 'Nilla wafers and our meal came to a wonderful close. \n\nThe staff was super attentive and checked on us throughout the evening.  High ceilings, hardwood floors, spacious tables, a solid jukebox, and a good bar area make this a fantastic addition to South Street.  I still smell like I've been roasting over a pit -- which is exactly what I should smell like when I leave a BBQ place! Okay, it's not as good as back home but hang a Texas state flag, put some Jerry Jeff Walker on the jukebox, and serve me a Shiner bock and I might not remember that I'm in Philly.",3,KOwAR2rZZMBXnmDcvAw16w

To be fair, they there was a groupon promotion going on (we showed up armed with a groupon as well) but, even though they seemed to be trying hard, the staff was pretty overwhelmed. There was also just one person in a small room cooking all the food, which seems like a recipe for delays.\n\nAs for the food itself, it wasn't bad, but was also pretty unremarkable. My breakfast burrito (one of the specials) mostly just tasted like a bunch of potates wrapped in a tortilla and pressed. There were a few bites in the middle that had a vaguely eggy, meaty and/or cheesy taste, and there was sour creme and salsa verde to put on top but, again, it was nothing particularly special. My wife's egg/cheese/bacon sandwich was more flavorful (also had a significant kick from the aioli), but wouldn't necessarily justify waiting as long as we did for it.\n\nThe decor and ambiance were generally pleasing, but I would recommend puting some blinds up on the windows and adjusting for time of day, as the sun was shining right in the very top of the window and right in people's eyes at the tables nearest to that side of the room.\n\nThe coffee was solid, though.

I read a great introduction to the restaurant in the paper and was looking forward to a great experience. The decor is very cool; a combination of old world meets modern. It's different and trendy which I think is hard to pull off.

And believe me if there was, I would say it every chance I could and to anyone who will listen.  But the chicken was overcooked and boring (the carrot mustard sauce seemed to be, separately, mustard and carrot puree), the risotto was undercooked (which I suppose is better than overcooked) and the pear, champagne, chocolate float was made with chocolate that hardened by the time the glass made it to the table.\n\nHonestly, I would not be writing this review at all, if I thought the service was fantastic or if anyone had asked me how we enjoyed the meal. I understand it takes some time to get into a groove and perfect the dishes on your menu. I tend not to be critical early on. However when I tried to give feedback to the staff, I was left feeling like no one really cared what I thought. The server never once asked how anything was and in fact he really should have noticed because none of us finished our plates: I left the entire breast of chicken, except 2 bites.  And when I asked to speak to someone I could give food feedback to (I preferred to tell them directly instead of just writing it here or telling ""10 of my friends""), the manager never once looked at me (the only female at the table) nor did he ever apologize for our disappointment in the food (I didn't even mention the service).\n\nAs someone who has been working in the food industry for more than 15 years, it is hard for me to write this.

I like the mason jar glasses and the tin plates and the bench seating.  A place like this could be called kitschy but Percy St does a good job of not making it so.\n\nNow onto the sides/appetizers.  I've loved every side/appetizer I have ever tasted here.  My favorites include the avocado salad (simple yet scrumptous), the mac and cheese (super cheesey with a tang to it), German potato salad (always was a bit scared of this dish until I tried Percy Streets), mustard green beans (another dish I didn't think I'd like, but its crazy good), and sweet potatoes (I would consider these as more of a dessert... a bit too sweet for me, but the husband gobbled it up).  I will say I was underwhelmed by the cole slaw.\n\nSo you are wondering... Jill L, what about the meat?  Now I am not a huge meat person so I usually eat a couple forkfuls and I'm done.  I find the meat to be a bit dry, but topped with one of the three BBQ sauces, it is pretty good.  I'm not blown away by any of the sauces.  But I also really like the Famous Daves sauces, so don't hold my word against Percy Street.  Also, I find it strange that the sandwiches come on white bread and not rolls.  \n\nA side note:  I haven't been able to make it to one, but if you can, get to Happy Hour- they have pretty good deals.\n\nA second side note:  If you are looking for a good restaurant week deal, try Percy Street.  For $35, you get two appetizers, two entrees (which come with two sides each), and two desserts.  For $20, you get an appetizer, entree, and dessert.  This is an incredible deal.

The food was generally good (though I'd take In Riva's pizza over this pizza any day). The service varied between ok and indifferent. \n\nThe one-star rating is because of what happened the day *after* we ate there. We had taken home what was left of the lasagna, and when we pulled it out of the microwave and started to eat it, we noticed that, under the sauce, there was a LIME STICKER ATTACHED TO THE NOODLES. \n\nI called the restaurant and asked for the manager and Kevin picked up. I explained what had happened and he apologized. He said he remembered our table and would credit us for the lasagna. He told me to email him to remind him of my name, which I did as soon as I hung up (kevin@petrucephilly.com). \n\nHe's never responded, even after I emailed again.\n\nAmazing that a restaurant would serve patrons a STICKER, offer to comp only the dish in question, and then blow off the customer.

Plain and simple it was not good.\n\nWe grew up in the suburbs and would go to Chinatown several times a year.  It was something special that we all enjoyed.  Occasionally you would get a bad dish but so what.  You could count on every restaurant getting the americanized basics right (wonton soup, fried rice, egg rolls).  I regret to say this place did not.\n\nThe sweet and sour soup was thick but just not tasty at all.  This was the first time in my life I had not finished a bowl of soup at a Chinese restaurant.  My sister got the won ton soup and did not finish it either.\n\nMy wife and I shared the kung pao shrimp which was devoid of taste.  I had never eaten something so colorful with so little flavor. My experience with kung pao dishes is that they are spicy.  No luck here.  I hoped this was just one bad dish.  To my chagrin, sampling the other entrees did not help.\n\nMy sister liked the shrimp in lobster sauce.  My wife and I did not.  The shrimp was mushy.  I think my sister was just happy to have a rare day away from home.  She would have raved about cold lumpy oatmeal which is what the lobster sauce resembled.\n\nMy son liked his General Tso tofu dish.  My daughter ate it later as leftovers and also liked it.  They are both strict vegetarians.  So they are used to eating tasteless food and pretending to like it.  And my daughter was starved because her flight was 3 hours late due to weather.  She also had very low standards because ""belly hungry!"".\n\nMaybe we angered the staff which may explain the poor food.  Our party of five arrived in two stages 30 minutes apart (due to the airport fiasco).  The coup de grace was when my mother-in-law threw up at the table.  I can't blame the food since I ate the same uninspired chicken fried rice she did and felt fine.  In retrospect it was good timing as it prevented us from picking through this awful food.  To my amazement, my wife had the staff pack up the remains which we later served to my starving daughter.

On one occasion friends of mine that had finished a meal there with me took home their leftovers in a paper bag, and on returning home, opened the bag to have three large cockroaches immediately escape from it into their apartment. On at least four other occasions, myself or my friends have suffered short-term stomach illness from the food here in the hours immediately after eating.

Chalkboards, interesting lighting over the bar, and the atmosphere was cool without being stuffy (or too country...no hay bales here!)\n\nWe had a reservation for 630pm but had massive issues finding a parking spot and finally walked in at 7pm. The downside (for us, not them) was that even on a Sunday night, they were so busy!! We didn't get a seat until 740pm. \n\nThey serve Yard's root beer (the local brewery) in a mason jar mug and it was fantastic. (Note to self, look into seeing if you can purchase this root beer for my own refrigerator) I then ordered mac & cheese...they use Cabot cheese which I've always found to be a great sharp cheese! And they put bread crumbs on the top. It was phenomenal. I'd seriously think about going back just for these two items. \n\nTim ordered ribs and fries. I ordered chicken and brussel sprouts. They asked if we wanted white bread for the table in case we wanted to make sandwiches. I said, yes! (I want to experience everything the way they want you to) \n\nI have to say, I LOVED the brussel sprouts. I've only had them one other time and expected them to come out whole but they were just the leaves in a bowl but they had been cooked with butter, garlic and lemon and were amazing little wilted pieces of goodness.\n\nI tried the 3 sauces they had on the table. Sweet Thang, Old Faithful, & Hot Mess. I wasn't a huge fan of any of them, but I'd say I liked Sweet Thang the best. I then made a sandwich with some chicken I pulled off the bone. I added pickles to the first half a sandwich I made. (very good) And I added coleslaw to the second half a sandwich I made. (also very good)\n\nI have however come to the conclusion that I do not LOVE the smoked flavor. I think I like it in small amounts, but after a while, I was over the meat. I also tried one of Tim's ribs. Same feeling with the smoke. Although I must point out, the meat was ""fall-off-the-bone"" which you don't see everywhere. (Probably Texas the Carolinas and Memphis for sure...which I intend to find out some day!)\n\nAll in all, I loved the root beer, mac & cheese and brussel sprouts. And of course the atmosphere. It was a fun night out. Everyone was personable and sweet. Just my own personal opinion of the smokey flavor that ruined it a bit!

As a vegan, I do agree with the other veggie Yelper who stated that it would have been helpful for them to label if their sauces were veggie friendly.. Not mandatory but helpful. I always research places before I dine and wrote the Hai Street before dining and the General Manager was very quick to respond with this list of veggie friendly options. In case anyone else out there is interested, here is the list.. Obiously, for your main ingredient you would choose the zucchini.. For your sauces you have the option of the following: Black pepper teriyaki, salsa verde, gochujang, ginger miso, and the spicy peanut dressing. Sadly the wasabi guac is NOT vegan, womp womp! But my boyfriend said it is delicious for all of you non vegans! All of the veggie toppings are vegan friendly except the papaya salad, as well as the crunchy toppings. I opted for the zucchini with brown rice and various veggie toppings with the ginger miso sauce. It was very tasty! I left feeling fulfilled. I saw that a lot of people were saying they felt that the portion sizes were small.. We were satisfied but we didn't come on empty. We both also had teas which were delicious as well.

Before coming here for the first time, I was a little skeptical about ""double-fried"" wings because honestly that sounds a like a greasy hot mess, but never fear, they are quite the opposite. They double fry the wings so they're not only crispy, but infused with flavor throughout. There are two flavors: soy garlic and spicy. Although I normally enjoy spicy foods, BonChon's spicy was my limit-- I can only eat two of them before begging for a glass of milk. On the other hand, the soy garlic is a dream: sweet, garlicky goodness without the burning fire of the spicy flavor. \n\nIn addition to the wonderful wings, Bonchon has a lunch special, even on weekends! It's $8.95 for 8 wings + a side (the fries are great). You can also get their fried rice as a part of the lunch special, but it's very mediocre. \n\nService here is definitely lacking.

There are some earlier reviewers that don't seem to get that. Any growing pains that also seem to have been referenced were nowhere in sight.\n\nOnto the grub:\n\nFirst off, I recommend coming with a group, because you should try it all. The ""Lockhart"" (all the meats, all the sides, and a dessert each), at $24pp, is a solid value and damnit if it's not fun when they fill your whole table with delicious smoky meats and bowl after bowl of solidly cooked sides. It was a bit overwhelming, but in a good way. It was great to get a chance to taste some of everything, and then build sandwiches with the favorites. Let me just say that I'm grateful that my buddies were too busy stuffing their own faces for me to feel too much shame for constructing a monstrosity of fatty, delicious smokiness that was the brisket-pork belly sandwich that I created and happily devoured. \n\nThe service was friendly and consistent, and desserts were straight-forward and delicious all around, with the pecan pie being a standout in my mind. If I had a small gripe, I'd say the beers could have a buck knocked off each price, but again, go with a group and get the growlers. There aren't many joints in this city that will drop a jug-o-beer on your table. Oh, and I guess it was a little dark, but in retrospect, I'm a bit grateful that the bits of brisket and pork belly that were inevitably stuck between my teeth went unnoticed by my cohorts until I came across the thoughtfully placed toothpicks in the men's bathroom.\n\nAll in all, an exciting addition to the Philly restaurant scene and a welcome contrast to all the precious little plates that you'll find in most other trendy places in the city. Not that I don't love many of those other restaurants, but sometimes a guy needs a break from having his food sprinkled with micro-greens and just wants a big pile of delicious, smoky meat.",2,052NGaUsuM8sONPAiE0Bow

All things considered, it's my favorite on either side of it, as I have yet to experience any of the famed BBQ meccas of the country in Tennessee, The Carolinas, KC, or Texas. \n\nPercy has a great interior accomplishing a nice blend of modern with traditional southern BBQ decor.  The ambiance is set nicely with dimly lit old fashioned looking lights.  There's plenty of wood trim all around and chalkboards on the walls with the drink specials.  Even the server stations have a look of old country style furniture. \n\nI started off with a couple of their specialty drinks.  The one I had to was the Hillbilly Gatorade which is Miller High Life, pickle juice, and BBQ sauce.  They say pickle juice helps prevent hangovers and what better way to get ahead of one than to put it in a drink.  The drink itself is an interesting one and I, unfortunately couldn't finish it.  I also had the Percy Street Punch that was very good and made with gin, sweet tea, pomegranate, and lemon.  As for the rest of the drink menu, it's quite impressive.  On their website, the extensive list is 3 pages even with a very small font!  Percy's beer list goes on for days and the bourbon and whiskey choices are endless that will make any southern alcoholic feel right at home-- no withdrawal here!\n\nWith all of the amazing choices on their menu, it's very difficult to make a decision.  They've managed to take out that annoying task from your dining experience with The Lockhart.  Be sure to bring your appetite because you're in store for a feast.  For 19 bucks a person, it gives people the chance to sample a lot of their menu.  It comes with chicken, brisket, and pulled pork and sides of beans, collard greens, German potato salad, and cole slaw.  I had to add on  a side of mac and cheese as well.  All of the meats were cooked to perfection and extremely moist.  My favorite of the trio was the chicken.  Each of the sides were equally amazing with special attention to the mac and cheese.  They use an extra sharp cheddar that really sets it apart from other m&cs.  \n\nThis was my second time I've been to Percy St., my first time being years ago.

I had the spicy & non spicy wings of course! They were amazing!! So much flavor and juicy...and even better and bigger then the ones I had at soho. I also had the bulgogi sliders.. So delicious.. I didn't get to try the others but I will definitely be there again! Besides the food... The customer service were awesome! If you think the services were bad then I suggest you go to soho!!

We have been searching for decent bbq here, and have not had much luck.  We were not disappointed.  The service was great, the juke box had some good music on it, and most importantly, the food was delicious.\n\nWe generally had the brisket or the ribs in our group.  We all loved the brisket.  The brisket came in your choice of moist or lean (""moist"" meaning it originally had more fat on it).  The meat had the nice pink ring from smoking on it (according to the waitress, they smoke the meat for about 12 hours).  The good news about the moist version was that they cut off all the fat before serving, so you got the extra tenderness without having to deal with the fat.  Everyone enjoyed the ribs, but one person felt that the ribs were not meaty enough. However, everyone agreed the food tasted great.\n\nThey gave us a choice of 3 sauces that are in bottles on the table -- the food is served without sauce (some other reviews said they only have one):  Old Faithful, which is a basic, slightly spicy sauce; Sweet, which had a good bit of molasses flavor and was very good; and Hot Mess, which was really spicy. The food was also served in traditional Texas bbq style with raw onion rings and pickles.\n\nFor sides, we had the German potato salad, the collard greens, the pinto beans and the corn on the cob.  They were all delicious.  One review described the beans as very spicy, but they were really not when we had them.  My daughter said that they put something extra delicious on the corn, too.\n\nDesserts were very good -- the pecan pie was great.  The berry cobbler was somewhat disappointing because it was more of a buckle, as opposed to a cobbler and was pretty dough-y.  The banana pudding was clearly homemade and had large slices of banana in it.\n\nThe beer selection was excellent, too:   many craft beers on tap or in cans.  Plus a full bar if you wanted a cocktail.  All in all, it was great and we can't wait to go back.  My dad grew up in Texas and said the whole experience really brought him back!",0,tu4tSawqHKQRYFXqCJRLbw

The others in our group got the Eggs Benny (didn't try), Shirred Eggs (had a bite of this, and it was seasoned perfectly!), Breakfast Pizza (my brother-in-law didn't like that it had homefries on it, and I think it ruined the overall taste too), and the Croque Madame (the French Toast portion of it was amazing, though I didn't care for the rest of the sandwich). \n\nI saw families with kids there, but they were pretty well-behaved, so I'm not sure whether to recommend this for kids, in general.

There are not much south India  restaurant here in philly . What we like about this place is food . If you love Dosa this is the place to come . \nWhat I don't like about this place is service which is below restaurant standard it seems like the kitchen is chaos and they don't have a proper food line in the kitchen  . For example we order 1 masala dosa and 1 rave Dosa .After half hour of wait the masala dosa came to the table and we both shared it but then we have to wait for another 20 mins for the next dosa which I think is little too much . They were nice and gave us discount but it was not the first time for us we have experienced the same kinda service previously but we will still come there just for the food . So if u are foodie and like to eat and yeah get a drink it's a byob because u have to wait long for food . Why not get a drink. \nSo overall food is 5 stars , Service is 2 star .

My burger was fantastic, and my friends enjoyed their steak nachos and mac & cheese with pulled pork, as well as the meatball sliders. Nothing came out of a food service bag or freezer - it seemed as if everything was freshly made, and the chef even shared some of his secrets to great mac & cheese, as well as offering some tasty homemade dill & garlic pickle chips after the meal.

As others have mentioned, they went through a menu change about a year ago, and from a business standpoint, I get it. The platters were a lot of meat and at some point, it can't be cost effective. And for those of us who can't eat half a pound of BBQ in a sitting, the more traditional entree items were welcome. However, by removing the platters and the meat choices all together, it killed the feeling of an authentic BBQ joint and now just feels like any other upscale theme restaurant in this town. Nail in the coffin? The tiny glass jars of sauce that replaced the ketchup bottles that once were. It's also really loud, even during an afternoon lunch.\n\nNow that I'm done mourning: the brisket sandwich is great. The hamburger is ok, but I've had better. The Mac and cheese is the stuff that dreams are made of. When the man and I go, we each order one because sharing it can lead to some nasty ""I want the last bite"" fights.

Overall good experience, worth 3.5 stars, but rounding down to just ""OK"" because the food needed some work. There were some amazing dishes, but even more ""A-OK"" dishes, and a few just bad dishes. And for the prices, these small portion-sized dishes should all be amazing. The service was great, and so was the atmosphere, such cute decor. But, for the prices, the food was not as impressive as other Spanish tapas places I've tried. \n\nThe EGGPLANT was AMAZING, best eggplant dish I've ever had. It was a thick slice of eggplant, that needed to be cut, it wasn't mushy like most eggplant dishes. The sauce on it was fantastic. Best dish of the night. (but its super small, so order 2). \n\nThe Octopus was also very good, with chickpeas. The seafood Paella was good, but for the 25-30 min prep time to cook it, not worth it. We ate all other dishes and could have been ready to leave by the time the paella was done. The rice in the paella was so crispy on top that it kept sticking in my teeth. \n\nAverage food was the short rib croquettes, and blistered peppers. \n\nNot so good food was the Spanish Tortilla; there was hardly any potatoes and tasted just like a tiny round egg omelet. For $9, very sad. Since we didn't get our traditional Spanish potato fix from the Spanish Tortilla, we tried the Patas Bravas next, which also was mediocre; the potatoes were better, but over cooked. Also, the cod croquettes were not worth the price, they tasted like fish sticks I ate when I was a kid. \n\nOverall, I'm bummed I didn't love Oloroso as much as everyone else who gave great reviews. Just needs some fixing of a few staple dishes, or, a reduction of price for the small size portions. If the food was better than I wouldn't mind the price tag.

People , who had been cooped up and burried under snow, for the last few months, rubbed their eyes and wandered the streets in bewilderment. The fact that some of them had been drinking since noon may have something to do with that, but many were just happy to be out in some fine weather. Including me.\n\nI came here for McThrills UYE at Percy St BBQ. It was my first excursion out since before Christmas, before snowmeggedan, before illness, and before tragedy. It really was the first nice day in 2010 and I was glad to take advantage of it like all the rest. Add to that, the excitement of getting to try some wicked BBQ and Yelp drinks, and I was all set.\n\nI was disappointed that I had to miss the original Elite event at Percy. It occured the day I got out of the hospital for diverticulitis, and there was no way I could make it. So now, here was my chance. \n  \nI met up with McThrill and we stormed the bar. UYE's are funny. There is no nametags to call attention to your Yelpitude, and Monica (who we met at the bar) put it the best, "" How will we know our kind?""  It actually isnt hard. Most are true to their profiles and when you are with McThrill, people flock to him like a beacon.  Our small group of 4 or 5 quickly doubled and tripled thanks to Michael W and his entourage.  The bar, which was just a smattering of people when we arrived, quickly became 5 deep within minutes and a good amount were Yelpers. It was great seeing some old friends, some not so old friends and meet some new friends. Nicely done Bill!\n\nI had starved myself for most of the day, in preparation of getting some BBQ. I started to worry when the place filled up and there was no sign of an empty table in sight. I owe Hilary P a world of gratitude for taking the initiative of finding out who wanted to eat, and getting a table (and letting me join). \n\nIt was a long wait for a table but it went easy, with 2 of my friends, Jack and Ginger as well as some other (less tasty) friends from Yelp. The smells coming from the kitchen were both heavenly and mocking. The staff at Percy was great, apologizing for the wait of a table. Its funny , but as we stood by the bar near the exit, we rarely saw anyone leave, people just didnt want to go.\n\nWe did finally sit, and we had a great cross section of Yelp Culture. There was Dave H, Stephen H with wife Cindy, myself, Hilary and Schuyler, Chris R and Caroline M ( I hope I got all the names and initials right, I didnt fact check). Their presence made the meal even that much better. Sadly, the whole UYE group couldnt fit together, and we were all split up, but at least McThrill and Yuri got a romantic dinner out of it ;)\n\nDuring the long wait, I looked at the menu board and sweated out having to make a decision. As we sat, my tablemates offered an interesting alternative to making a decision...The Lockhart. The Lockhart is basically where you get one of everything on the menu. Its $24 per person and includes a dessert and it seemed like the right thing to do.\n\nIt started out slowly, a basket of bread here, a bowl of chili there, and then the wonderful staff of Percy St, ""made it rain"" This is when the Civilized Frenzy began(see definition). Foods just passed in front of us and we forked it on our plates and passed it along. No one got greedy (although I thought about hiding the Mac and cheese in my lap) and no one needed to be. The food was delicious and plentiful (except for those beans that got passed around like the ""Old Maid""), and it was a communal like atmosphere.\n\nWhen the frenzy was over and nothing but those beans and a few slices of bread  were left. We all felt full and satisfied. It is hard to pic a favorite, but the Mac and cheese and ribs were pretty damn good. Even though we didnt save room for dessert, we were getting it and no one was disappointed. I got the Pecan Pie with homemade icecream (diverticulitis be dammned!) and it was as good a pie as id had.\n\nI soon saw why I didnt see anyone leave Percy St...they couldnt.  Weighed down with deliciousness, we wanted to leave but were stuck in our bench. Mr Creasote would have been proud, but I was glad I didnt really need a bucket. As we made our way out and said our goodbyes, we all had the feeling that we had been a part of something big and had shared a common experience, like Vietnam vets or hostages in a robbery (but in a good way). Later, when one of us meets another, we only need to look into the others eyes, and nod, with a knowing glance that conjures the name Percy St.",8,AvGJVv7Z3a0q1MJT1Ykd0w

After hearing a few of my friends rave about Sweetgreen and its superiority over Honeygrow (buncha noodles, not enough substance IMO for the price), I wanted to see for myself what this place was all about.   \n\nIt was about 8:30PM on a Wednesday and my tipsy ass (SIPs, I don't normally drink on Wednesdays...) passed up the option of a getting a WAWA sub to be a bit healthier.  I used a friend's Sweetgreen ordering app to attempt to get myself something that would rival the likes of a wawa mac and cheese.  \n\nThe app is similar to Honeygrow's ordering system- pick the base [greens, rice, etc., although on this app I was limited to only two choices;  if I recall correctly Honeygrow's options are unlimited and sometimes a girl wants spinach, arugula, AND mesclun on her salad...] then pick protein/additional toppings (4? idr), then pick more additional toppings for an extra charge, and then pick a dressing.  Pretty straight forward, and some good seasonal options.  \n\nThe salad that I ordered: mesclun & arugula with cucumbers, watermelon, za'atar bread crumbs, blackened chicken thighs, and pesto dressing.  Was hungry and excited.  I set to pick up the salad at 9PM, and that's when my problems began. \n\nI arrived outside of Sweetgreen about 8:45- early, but I was planning to wait it out or see if they could make it ahead of time.  To my surprise, the store was locked.  This location claims it stays open until 10, so I was confused.  Someone else outside of the store wanted to order but couldn't get in.  Since I had already paid for my salad, I was intent on getting it. I knocked on the door and one of the workers finally acknowledged me, mouthed something like ""pick-up?"" and then let me inside.  \n\nMy salad was already made, and as they were about to hand it to me, told me that they had run out of cucumbers and bread crumbs.  If I hadn't said anything, they would have been happy to give me a salad with just greens, chicken, and watermelon for around 10 bucks.  I asked what they could replace the missing items with, and the salad girl rolled her eyes at me and opened my salad to add something else.  I asked for sweet potatoes, which she added on, and then she proceeded to actually knock over my bowl on the counter, spill the contents, scoop them all back up and put them back in with only half of what was originally in there. She then asked one of her co-workers (who was standing right behind her, not doing anything) if she could take over because she just couldn't do it anymore. Co-worker said no.  There was a lot of attitude involved and it made me uncomfortable.  She then said 'oh, we actually do have breadcrumbs"" (??? why not just add them in the first place), and then she walked over to that station and added them on too.  \n\nI got my salad, was mostly underwhelmed but at least I was full once I finished it.  Pesto dressing was good, that's really all I can say.\n\nFor a pick-up order, the service was awful and I can't imagine what going there to actually order a salad would be like.  Also still confused why they were closed so early.  I will not be going back.",1,FhL7KojOHBilKE63ybupVw

You sit wherever you can, so expect to share a table with others.  (3) The ceilings are high, but there is not a lot of sound-proofing.

I usually always order the spicy soppressata, because they put honey on it, and the sweet/spicy is my fav. flavor combo. Goes great with their wines, which I also enjoy. We also enjoy the sausage one. \n\nThis past time we ordered their mushroom pizza, and a cherry tomato one with some heat. The mushroom was great, but I would say the hot cherry tomato one felt a bit loose on the cheese from all the veggie's water, although the crust was fine. It also could have been hotter to my taste, so perhaps more chili oil? So while it was still a good pizza, I'll def. be returning to my first love next time (or the delicious mushroom, if I'm in that mood). 3/4 of our attempts is not bad! \n\nI also ordered their old fashioned, and asked for light sugar. It came to the table pretty sweet, which made me wonder what full sugar would be like. Overall it was just not how I like them, it was much too pink. (For a good Old Fashioned: See Teresa's (really expensive one's) in Wayne, PA). \n\nWe'll keep coming back here! We found out about this place because they provided pizzas to a food kitchen downtown on Christmas Eve a couple years ago.

We needed you and we love that you are here. \n\nPROs:\nVenue is terrific. Love the aesthetic, very welcoming and unique. Beer was excellent. The barracuda was superb. We came at the tail of happy hour and it looked like every stroller and child in this zip code was in attendance. The family scene cleared out by about 8:30 (note to self to arrive later) but I appreciated the nice mixed crowd. It was a fun, relaxed but slightly upscale vibe. The custom bar & tables are gorgeous. \n\nI love the fact that the hours are so extended and I'm excited to stop in during the week for coffee and a pastry and a change of scenery from my home office. Staff was very friendly. Loved the wall art. \n\nCONs:\nOnly one gripe but it's a big one. The menu is a total bummer if you don't like Mediterranean food (which we don't). Where is the pizza??!!!!! There are zero ""typical"" food choices. Not a one. We were really looking forward to a place to walk to after work for dinner and a few beers but unfortunately this will not be the place.

After meeting with them today, I'm looking forward to coming back at least once a month, since today was a great experience, and everyone reached out and was especially courteous. They really won the ""gold star"" for customer service. Both food and service were top-notch.  Thanks!\n\n\nOriginal review:\nLucky Strike offers a lunch promotion that seems like a great deal on paper.  Since it's only a few blocks away from where I work, getting a few friends together for a fun game of bowling, decent food, all for ten dollars in center city sounds like a great idea in theory.  Where it fails, however, is in execution.\nI understand that I'm not bowling at a restaurant - I'm eating at a bowling alley.  \n\nThat being said, here's how the offer is supposed to work. The so-called ""7/10 Split"" offers you a choice of one of eight entrees (salads, burger, chicken sandwich, pizzas), and unlimited soda/iced tea.  This includes a free game of bowling for your group plus free shoe rental.  For ten dollars, this is an awesome idea. ""Idea"" being the key word.\n\nI've tried this twice, each with a group (four people the first time, five the second). Yes, it's a lounge and has the lounge atmosphere, which is nice.  Music is fine, and the bowling is easy to set up and fun.  No problem with shoe rental (but bring socks with you, or you'll pay about 3 or 4 dollars to buy a pair of socks.  No disposables around). \n\nOur group arrived at about noon (the promotion runs from 11:30am to 2:00pm M-F). Basically, you buy lunch and get a free game of bowling.  The server took our drink order which was delivered promptly, and we reviewed the menu and placed our orders. We started bowling, and waited for the food.  And waited. And waited. Five people bowled nearly an entire game of bowling each.  And we waited. About 1:00pm, our food came out.  Sixty. . . minutes. . . later.  Zzzzz....\n\nIt took an hour for four chicken sandwiches and a burger to arrive. I'm no chef - I've never worked in a restaurant/diner, etc., but I would think that it wouldn't take nearly as long.  Oh, and did I mention, we were the only group on the entire floor.  No one else on the lanes, no one else having lunch. Our group were the only ones, outside of staff (and there was more staff than there were paying customers), on the floor (and maybe a couple at the pool tables trying for a secret rendezvous of some sort - no better place than midday at Lucky Strike. No one is liable to see you there).\n\nI had the chicken cobb sandwich, which came with a side of fries.  The food was good, it seemed fresh - I have no reason to complain about the food. Everyone seemed satisfied with it (it's not a greasy spoon place, there was a quasi-upscale quality to the food).\n\nI'll admit, I hoped the first experience was an exception, and imagined that returning about a month later would lead to something better.  It didn't.  It doesn't look like it's ever going to change. Once again, the promotion is a great idea, and the bowling is easy to get started - the wait for the food, however, is unacceptable, and really a disappointment.  I generally have an hour for lunch, and would hope that I could squeeze in a game of bowling and a quick bite to eat in that hour - no such luck, twice.\n\nI actually want to try this again, but I plan to call in the food order about 20-30 minutes before I arrive, so that the wait won't be as long.  Ridiculous, but in order for this idea to work as planned, I think it's the only way. Whether it's mismanagement of the kitchen, or just overall apathy, they shouldn't offer a promotion if they can't execute it in a reasonable amount of time.",0,Gxoye3Qdfn5I0uG2Sf3zAQ

As she said we ordered from here in the past and it was okay, but last night was awful. First off I paid 34 dollars for food that was worse than the stuff that is sold from the carts in center city. (I would have paid less at the carts) Second, the woman who took my order on the phone was completely rude and seemed as if taking my order was a burden. \n\nI ordered Garlic Chicken and my wife ordered Shrimp with Tofu. My wife loves Tofu and figured her order would be a safe bet. My wife's food was bathed in sauce as was mine the food lacked any flavor other than that of the sauce that probably came from an industrial sized Kikkomen container. The spare ribs were tasteless and for the most part meatless. The shrimp toast was soaked with so much deep fryer grease that I probably should take an extra Crestor just to counteract the effects. \n\nI am actually not sure if the people who run this place are actually Chinese. I have read some where else that it is an American run Chinese restaurant but I cannot confirm this. (This reminds me of that scene in Rush Hour 2 with Don Cheadle) However if this is the case it would explain why the food is so poor. \n\nAll in all if we decide on Chinese food late at night I think I will take a pass on JC and have a Peanut Butter and Jelly sandwich instead.",5,WbcJ18WgaCP4CgaSy3129A

Think of all the beautiful things that remind us that happiness is not a pipe dream. Here's a list of them for you:\n\nSushi Burritos.\n\nWelp, that's about all I need to get me out of the gutter.\n\nI ate at Hai Street Kitchen three times in just as many days. I was too intimidated to make my own custom roll in light of their vast quantity of choices. I ordered their suggested menu items. \n\nSlammin Salmon - Awesome. Perfectly pickled mango with some spicy sauce, lettuce, onion, and raw salmon.  It combined the discipline and vinegary goodness of sushi with the convenience and all-at-once-in-your-face-ness of a burrito. Wow.\n\nThe Crunch - This is their shrimp tempura offering and I decided to spice it up with some wasabi guacamole. It was very good.\n\nThe Hai Street Chicken - This is their chicken teriyaki offering. Although I liked it, it didn't really hold a candle to the other two. The sauce was a little too sweet for my liking.\n\nAll of these offerings were ordered ""Go Zilla"" (which basically means ""large""). I recommend this because the regular sizes aren't really big enough to sate a fully-grown human.\n\nA note about price - Yeah it is a little pricey for what you get, but think about it this way - Those signs that hang on the wall, patting you on the back for eating here because the food is sustainable and such - Those signs cost money. Pay your premium for that little bit of extra encouragement you get for supporting a business that at least puts effort into telling you how sustainable the food is and how cool you are for buying it.\n\nAlso, think about this in sushi terms - To get a standard roll at a sushi restaurant with all these ingredients, cut up and arranged very nicely, there's gonna be at least a 15 dollar cost. By taking these ingredients and putting them in a clean, take-out format, Hai Street is actually saving you money.\n\nThe hibiscus green tea didn't really impress me (it was too sweet). Also, my review may be skewed because I went at very odd times and missed any sort of lunch or dinner lines.\n\nThe More You Know.\n\nEdit: after several visits, the slammin salmon alone has earned this place 5 stars. The others really don't have the magic for me in comparison.",8,NNgQ8fV5ARQgHw-Ob7l50A

Servers, bussers and food runners have hard jobs, and deserve all our respect. However, in the case of tbis restaurant, I have to complain (and I did during my visit).\nI brought my mom here for Mother's day -we were both craving Indian food- and were seated right away. The dining room is spacious, has a nice, minimalist decor, and the music coming through the speakers was entertaining but at a very reasonable volume. \nOur server was nice enough to explain some of the menu items (menus themselves are very non-descriptive if you're not specifically familuar with South Indian cuisine). \nI'm gonna talk about the food first, then the service. \nWe ordered Baijjis for appetizers: potatoes, bread or onions deep fried in a mildly spiced batter, accompanied with a very yummy yogurt sauce. Very decent. \nFor entrees, my mother ordered some kind of eggplant stew, which was spicy, flavorful and frankly delicious. We did have to send the accompanying bowl of basmati rice back 3 times because it was stone cold. Alarming. \nFor my entree, I ordered a Dosa: a large flat crepe, folded over and stuffed with spiced mutton, peppers and onions, accompanied with three distinct sauces. It was, admittedly, very very delicious. \nSo if the food was so good, why are they getting two stars? Well the answer is simple: the Dosa took OVER AN HOUR to come out. My mother was left eating her eggplant alone while I searched for someone, anyone, to explain what was happening. We mentioned the long wait period to three different staff people as they passed by; our server very clearly avoiding coming anywhere near our table. From the conversation i saw her have with the manager, my guess is she forgot to put my order in. While that is a forgivable mistake, purposefully avoiding your tables is amateurish service, and not worth the nothing-to-sneeze-at price tag of eating at this establishment. NO ONE came over to explain what was happening except for a poor food runner obviously going out of his way to cover someone else's mistake. \nAfter an hour of waiting, my food finally came out, and, like I said, it was delicious. At no point did anyone (and certainly not our joke of a server) come to check how everything was or apologize. \nI've worked in the restaurant world for many years and usually, when a customer is done wrong like this, there's some kind of compensation: a discount on the check or maybe a drink or desert on the house. Not this time. No one ever even approached us. We got our bill ($50!) And never heard from any staff person again. \n\nWriting this review pains me, I've worked these jobs and I knowbhow hard they can be. But not taking responsibility for your mistakes is simply unacceptable. Suffice to say, we will never be returning to this establishment. I hope they can sort their service out because the food was truly delicious.",3,Hi7N--1JwKNnyHo0-R09SQ

It's a cute little building with a window for pickup but also a decent space inside where you can order and sit down (in non-COVID times). Cute interior! We walked down on a Sunday AM - a good number of people waiting for their food to be prepared, but we were able to walk right in and place our order without waiting. \n\nRowhome offers a good number of coffee options, both drip and espresso offerings. We both ordered the cortado, which was nicely done - just bitter enough but also creamy with the milk that it was a nice pick me up in the AM. As mentioned, they are known for their pretzels, so we had to go for this. I went for the breakfast sandwich on an everything pretzel with egg, cheese, and sage sausage. The pretzel didn't really appear to be ""everything"" once I got into opening it, but the toppings could have disintegrated on the walk. The sandwich filling was excellent though - sausage was quite sage-forward, which was a nice touch, and the cheese was perfectly melty. Overall, really nicely done and very filling! My fiancee went for the same but with bacon instead of sausage, and he was a big fan of his as well! We were very pleased with our breakfast at Rowhome, and we were happy with our minimal wait and nearness to park areas to pop a squat to enjoy our loot. \n\nWe really enjoyed our AM at Rowhome, and we hope to make it back to try other pretzels + / - other sandwich fillings and definitely other coffee options!

I know this is par for the course in a juice bar, but the blender is a noisy distraction. \n\nThe biggest problem I have encountered not once, not twice, but THREE times at Jar Bar is that they run out of entrees quite frequently, or they just don't have them prepared.  The other day I walked in at 11 am and none of the lunch items were ready.  Today they ran out of the mediterranean salad - and wouldn't? couldn't? make another one.  I don't get it.  Staff is not particularly helpful- I don't ask that you have the menu memorized, but you can't tell me off the top of your head what is in a dish: what's up with that?\n\nThe food is good - not great - and definitely overpriced.  Five dollars for kale chips is outrageous and I'm not afraid to say it!  I had the Mediterranean salad which was flavorful and a nice size portion in comparison.  The sweet potato pasta is an enormous disappointment, and this is coming from someone who is borderline obsessed with sweet potatos.  It was totally dry, and lacking in taste.

Clearly we liked it enough to return!  Truth be told, my first visit was a 5 star one, and the 2nd was 3-4.\n\nLets start with ambiance:  4/5. This place is so teeny tiny and the tables quite close together.  however, it feels legit cozy and when its busy, you appreciate having a table at all!  First visit, the place was slam packed.  This 2nd one wasnt as insane but was getting there was we left. \n\nMenu: 5/5 - great things to pick from even for us vegetarians.  There were plenty of regular menu items AND specials for the veg-heads out there.  We tried the mushroom bao buns (always get the bao buns), tempura, bimibap (forgive the spelling) roll, and the tofu salad.  I love salads in general but extra loved this one with avocado, seaweed salad, tofu, etc and a great sesame dressing.  The bimbibap (still wrong) roll was ok but not thrilling. My dining partners tried a variety of other rolls which were a huge hit for them.  The triple double tuna was a favorite of the pescatarians at the table.\n\nService: 5/5.  This place is BYOB (come prepared) and as soon as we were sat, they brought us glasses, opened up the red to breath, and brought a bucket for the bubbles.  Service was very good from there forward. \n\nOverall, I would definitely return for round 3!",0,rAgCPqxaQKgd7XQVhePBeA

Our waitress came over immediately and was really professional and helpful. I generally prefer to try at least one item that a server recommends - it ups the chances that I'll get something good, or at least interesting - and she was really helpful in pointing out a few of her favorites and a few of the most popular items. \n\nEnded up ordering the shrimp tostadas and pork chop tacos, the latter was the special of the night. I unfortunately wasn't that impressed with either. \n\nPork Chop Tacos: with cilantro, onion, and cactus. I feel like there was more cactus than pork on the taco, which was unfortunate because the acidity and bitterness of the cactus ended up overpowering all other flavors. The pork that was there was chopped into tiny bits and was quite fatty and a bit under salted. After taking off a bit of the cactus the tacos was pretty good, but nothing to rave about. \n\nShrimp Tostadas: cortijo cheese, avocado puree, lettuce, raw onion, spicy onion. I got the shrimp tacos on the recommendation of our waitress, and they were pretty good but not great. The shrimp were a good consistency and mix of spicy and sweet, and the tortilla was perfectly crispy, but there was no real bite. \n\nThere's definitely better Mexican food in the city, but if you're nearby and hungry this'll do just fine too.",4,CcqpZkc5ngs88akzQ0rFHg

They sat us upstairs and something is wrong with their electric because the lights dimmed and brightened the entire 3 hours we were forced to be there. \n\nAnyway to sum up our terrible time:\n1. The service was terribly slow (Terrance was our waiter)\n2. It was 20 minutes before we got anything to drink. Not even water!!! \n3. Another hour before we got our food (the biscuits alone took 20 minutes after we finally got drinks)\n4. We asked for refills on drinks and they never came. \n5. We asked for boxes and that took 15 minutes. \n6. We asked for checks and that took another 30 minutes. \n7. After all of the terrible service the waiter wrote in his 20% (since when is it 20%!) gratuity of $50. He is the reason people hate gratuity being added to large parties. Because for some that just means they can give horrible service. \n\nWe had a 9:30 reservation and couldn't leave until 12:15am!!!!!! Because they were just soooooo slow!! Stay away and eat elsewhere.",4,HMT-QNZI2rd8Tjb5l6JxSA

My restaurant experience was like a series of unfortunate events. We were the only patrons of the restaurant for lunch around 11 am, our party consisted of 7 people. This review will skip over the facilities, but I shall mention that it was unclean and run-down. \n\nFirst unfortunate event was my friend received a cup with pink lipstick stain on it. Second the server was not a good server at all, she didn't know what dishes were what. At one point she was using a spoon to mix up her pho dish to see what was in it. She order pho bo vien and she was looking for the meatballs in it (there weren't any...). \n\nNow we should get to the dishes. We ordered 2 spring rolls and banh xeo for appetizers (these came way after the main entrees). One of my other friends ordered bun bo hue but she received something I do not know (it had pho broth, bun bo hue noodles and none of the right meat). My dish was decent can't complain too much on this. I order com soun. \n\nOn a positive note this will be a unforgettable experience between my friends and I will never forget and be talked about for the next couple months.

A few times when I've gone for dinner there's been a bit of a wait but you can sit at the bar for a while and have a drink while you wait for your table.

Now that I got that off my chest, lets talk about the vibe when you walk in the door.  Think dark swanky lounge downstairs.  They had projected black and white images of famous Cubans up on the walls.  The lounge has couches with tables around the perimeter.  The lounge also has a bar towards the front with some gorgeous people sit amongst it.

I was blown away by the food.  \n\nOh shit... i forgot the drinks...\nWhen in Cuba, do as the Cubans do.  I saw 3 or 4 types of Mojitos on the menu, so i went with one of those.  it was pretty average with a piece of sugar cane sticking out of it.\n\nOK, back to the food.  My friend and I started out with the rainbow ceviche.  It had pieces of Tuna, Salmon and Fluke i believe. It was great.  The citrus marinade used to ""cook"" the fish was perfect.  A perfect blend of sweet and sour matched well with the savory taste of the fish.  Best ceviche I've had since my trip to Costa Rica.  This was my friend's first experience with Ceviche and he was a huge fan.  \n\nWe both got the crispy pork as an entree.  It came upon a bed of mashed yuka and some type of Latin inspired slaw.  The pork was tender and juicy  yet crispy on the outside.  We got some fried Plantains on the side.  I heart fried plantains.  I would roll up to this bar to get an (average tasting) mojito just so i could get some of those delicious plantains as I sip my cocktail.  And let me tell you, the two of us, couldn't finish the mound of plantains brought to us and believe me, i tried.  \n\nAfter eating and drinking for an hour or two, I was SO stuffed, I wish i could have tried desert but there just wasn't any room.

It seemed like it struggled a bit at first and was literally never open when we tried to go. Recently we noticed it was open and now it seems that the business is part of the Slice company. We finally got around to trying it this weekend and ordered a pick-up order. I couldn't find a menu on their website, but found some pictures of the menu on their Facebook page. I had to call a few times before I got through to anyone, but once the order was placed, it was ready quickly in 15 minutes.\n\nWe got a spinach pizza and added mushrooms. The pizza had spinach, tomatoes, and ricotta on it. The pizza was okay, nothing amazing. I think 17 bucks is a little overpriced for the quality even though it was a decent size. We also got the Fiesta salad, consisting of lettuce, tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, zucchini fritters, and roasted red peppers. Probably should have added more veggies to the salad cause it was a little bare bones. It was also fine, but nothing special.

Since moving from West Philly to Queen Village about a year ago,  I have often made trips to 42nd and Chestnut to eat at the original location. I was overjoyed when I heard that Kabobeesh was opening a new location in my neighborhood. Really, like I was checking their Facebook page compulsively for a few weeks.\n\nI've eaten at every Indian/chaat restaurant in West Philly, and there's no question in my mind that Kabobeesh is the most authentic and delicious south Asian food that you'll find on that side of town. The verdict on Kabobeesh's brand new South Street location? Just as delicious, if not better, than the original.\n\nI've had almost everything on the menu at some point, so this is what I'd recommend doing:\n-It's Pakistani food, not Indian, but there's a good bit of overlap. If you like the latter, you'll probably like the former, and the converse is probably true.\n-Get a platter! You'll get one of their signature grilled meats, rice, a vegetable side, and a salad. Oh and it comes with naan. It's worth going just for the naan bread. For two people, a platter plus an extra vegetable side and extra naan is plenty for two people. So, dinner for two for just over $15. Not bad.\n-I'm not a vegetarian, but am a huge fan of going with the veg options at Kabobeesh. There is a rotating schedule of what dishes are available. I recommend the okra, as well as the chana masala.\n-If meat is your thing, the resham beef/chicken kabobs and the lamb are fabulous.\n-Most dishes are going to be spicy. The chana (chickpea) masala can be surprisingly spicy, but it can vary a little from visit to visit. It's not overwhelming for someone with a more sensitive palate (i.e my wife) but I would stay away from the sauce-based dishes and stick with the grilled meats or the fish.\n-It's BYOB. Pick up a beer in the neighborhood, or swing by the store at 7th and South for wine or spirits.\n-Don't freak out if you are waiting 10 minutes for what you expect to be fast food. They are most likely making the bread in the tandoori oven or grilling your meats.\n\nReally no complaints. The interior is much more modern than the West Philly location, and feels clean. I'm thrilled that Kabobeesh has expanded, and will be going back often.",0,KfkZKleVLY_JmrdG0rpX7A

We had a certificate from Restaurants.com and wanted to use it before we forgot about it.  Did eat at this place before during the summer and never had any problems before.  Nevertheless, we arrived about 7:30 pm and the entire place was empty except for the three employees sitting at the bar looking at their phones.  We were seated near the kitchen by our server Hailey.  We ordered the chicken dumplings (which were not bad).  For our entrees I ordered the filet mignon (well done) and my girlfriend ordered the cognac tilapia.  Our food arrived quickly (good thing since we were still the only people there),  however my steak and her tilapia were so bland that we could have changed plates and never noticed that we were eating different proteins.  \nWhen we received the bill we told our server that we had a certificate from Restaurants.com for $50.  We were then told by our server Hailey that to use the certificate our bill would have to be a minimum of $100.  Of course we ordered more drinks to get to that $100 and gave Hailey our certificate information.  She gets my certificate information and then goes to get my final bill.  When she returns she tells me that because we had promotional drinks (Happy Hour) that our certificate will not go through.  We can order more food or more drinks to get to this level.  I explain to her that we neither want any more to eat or drink, and we just want to pay our bill.  By this time it is 8:45.  She goes and talks to another employee (I believe her name is Christine) and returns to tell me that we can either:\n a) Pay the entire bill and they will validate the certificate for use at a future date or\n b) I can order more items to get to the $100 threshold without the promotional drinks.  \nAt this point I asked to speak to a manager and was introduced to the young lady that Hailey had been discussing our problem with, Christine.  Christine proceeds to tell me the exact same things that Hailey was, telling us that we had only two options.  Finally my girlfriend says ""Why don't you remove the promotional drinks off our bill and replace them with regular priced drinks off the menu to match the cost of our drinks so that we can use the certificate""?    When it was said earlier to Hailey she stated it was not anything that could be done, but Christine says okay to trying it.  She now brings us an updated bill that is now more than the original bill by $15.  When I look at the amounts they kept the total number of promotional drinks that we had however they charged us at the regular drink prices.  When I asked about that, Christine tells me that they have to keep the total amount of drinks that we purchased on the bill.  When I asked her ""Do you really think that I should pay $15 more for drinks that I didn't have"" she tells me that I agreed to this.  Again I ask to speak to the manager and was told that they were running late but should be there soon.  By now it is 9:15.\nAt this time I tell me girlfriend to drive home in my car since the time at my meter was almost up as I waited for the manager to arrive.  When it was 10:00 I decided that I had spent enough time waiting to come to a resolution about my bill.  At that time Christine approached me to tell me that she had gotten off the phone with the manager and that they would not be there for another hour.  I then told her that ""I had been more than reasonable in trying to come up with a solution to this, and after doing the math my bill including gratuity shouldn't be more than $62"".  I also told her that if she didn't figure out what she was going to do about my bill in the next 5 minutes I was walking out due to the fact that I spent more time there about my bill then I did with my meal.  Christine then stated that her ""Bouncer"" would be there shortly and they would see about me leaving. When I told her I was leaving she said ""We will see about that, I am sending one of my employees over"".  Now the guy that comes over introduces himself as a manager, I noticed her at the bar talking to someone but I did not notice when he came in.  He was not there when I originally arrived at the restaurant.  Unfortunately, I do not remember his name.  He asks me what the problem is and I explain it to him.  He is dumbfounded when he discovers that I had more than just drinks but that I also had entrees.  He stated ""Oh, they didn't tell me that you had entrees as well"".  In the midst of talking to this guy the bartender comes up to me with a bill for $62 and says ""This is the best I can do"".\n\nOut of all of the people I dealt with that evening, the only person who seemed to have any sense was the bartender and I never had any interactions with him until he gave me my final bill.  With that being said, Bleu Martini will never get the opportunity again for me to spend my money in their restaurant/lounge/club - whatever type of place it is.",3,CDhnPhna2wBqje78sZjjFg

It's not terrific, and it's not terrible, but certainly palatable for the professional crowd.  I've been here twice and have had both the salad and the stir fry.  While the food is good, it's nothing to write home about, and it solidifies my notion that white boys should never make Asian noodles.\n\nOn my last visit, I decided to try the stir fry.  I went with the Smoked Oyster Noodles, which describes the sauce only (nary a smoked oyster to be found in the actual noodles).  It comes with scallions, ""naturally raised pork"", shiitake mushrooms, egg noodles, bok choy, and eggplant.  It is perfectly fine to eat, and at about $10 for the noodles, I felt compelled to get my money's worth.  \n\nBut as I was eating it, I couldn't help but thinking that something about it felt contrived. Maybe it was the fact that the dish didn't have a lot of flavor, and despite the fact that the ingredients meshed well together, there was something inorganic about it.  I even tried to revive the dish with some heat, but not even a healthy dose of their off-brand sriracha (ok first of all, don't you dare overcharge me for noodles and then not have the balls to offer the real deal sriracha instead of that imitation crap you have instead.  If there's no rooster on the bottle, I want no part in it.) could make the dish taste better.  I don't think it tasted bad, but there's a lot of room for improvement.  Let's just say that the Chinese lunch trucks that offer the same noodle dishes at a fraction of the cost shouldn't be worried.\n\nI appreciate the locally grown food and the willingness to be ""healthy"", ""local"", and ""organic"" and what not, but at the end of the day, my major complaints are that the food, while good, is not great, and you can get much better and cheaper options nearby.  The salad at Morris', with Stephen Starr Catering no doubt, is like half the cost of what you would end up paying for salad here.  Overall, cool atmosphere, cool concept, and decent food, but it's expensive and bland and your money can be better spent elsewhere.",2,NqZJMXmwEtirJvx-qpyLmQ

I forget the names but one of them had shrimp tempura w/ avocado and various fruit and fish on top (i.e. salmon, tuna, eel, strawberry, kiwi, mango) - I got it without eel, b/c I just can't do it, but a friend had the eel and said it was great. (That's another thing, the staff was accommodating and everyone there was very nice, including the cooks!). The other roll was tuna with avocado (I think) topped with yellowtail and kiwi -- there was also a bit of fresh jalepeno thrown in there somewhere which added a bit of heat at the end which gave a nice interest to the roll. We also had crunchy spicy tuna and spicy scallop. All of the rolls were DELICIOUS! The fish was just SO FRESH which is really the most important thing. Dessert was good too.

The food is good  WHEN it's good - the fried chicken, greens and iced tea are amazing - but the food and overall experience is inconsistent. While everyone there is always friendly, the wait time, inability to make a reservation for less than a party of eight, and inconsistency in food taste and presentation are my biggest issues. Twice I have taken out of town guests there trying to show them a good time and have been embarrassed. They either are not honest about the wait time or are miscalculating it.  After a four hour wait (which we were told would only be two hours), the food was not the greatest, although the server was attentive and the chef even came out at 1AM to thank us for waiting. We shifted from standing in the crowded bar to sitting in the bar area to sitting in the lounge during our four hour wait to be seated, and unable to think of anywhere else we could eat after investing 2.5 hrs waiting, we decided to wait it out.  Another time, we took advantage of a pre-show special to dine in before Fela, and due to the hostess' oversight we were seated out of order and missed the first 15 minutes of our show. She promised to seat us in 15 minutes but instead sat another couple who came in 10 minutes after us. Ms. Tootsies is a great concept but they do not have the supply to meet the demand in my opinion.  The lounge is unnecessary when parties are waiting 3 and 4 hours.

One thing that surprised me about it was the amount of fish on the menu, and my meal took a very fishy turn (in a good way), so if you're interested in consuming their land dwelling options, you might want to skip on to another yelper. To get the ball rolling, the mojitos were very good and the doughy little bread they put out was nothing short of delicious. I split the ceviche tasting menu (deal?) with the three other people I was with for an appetizer and I enjoyed all of the ceviches we selected, a good indicator that you'll be safe with all the options here. The flavors were complex and none of them tasted too similar to each other, despite the fact that they were all essentially the same thing. Without giving it much thought, I ordered the sugarcane tuna dish, which of course, was more raw fish. It was very good, but I wouldn't recommend it for following up ceviche. We also got a Crujientes side for the table. For those of you non-Cubano yelpers, that is: Plantain, malanga chips, corn nuts and Russian sun corn. This was a great side... it was a nice basket of deliciousness to go with our entrees. I finished up the meal with an excellent Flan dessert (which included some delicious ice cream). Alma is a little on the pricey side, but I'd recommend trying as much as you can in one visit and spending around $100 for two.

The Caesar salad was made with tomatoes, cucumbers and no croutons.  Never heard of that kind of Caesar salad.  Shrimp dumplings we OK but needed the soy sauce.  Calamari was OK with little flavor without the dip.  The entrees we had were Filet & Sea Bass.  Filet was way too salty.  Mashed potatoes had no flavor and tasted like they had been made with water instead of milk/cream. I am allergic to peppers and the veggies were almost all peppers.  The menu made no mention of that.  The best part of the meal was the cheesecake.  It was awesome.  The cheesecake is why it gets 1 star.  Even at restaurant week prices, it was not worth it.\n\nService left much to be desired.  Our waitress was introduced as ""the best"".  She was not.

We then ordered the Parmesean Crusted Lamb Chops (medium well), since the seafood lover's delight would be without the crab.\n\n20 minutes later, the waitress returns and says the ""consistency of the crab mac and cheese was not right, so they would not be serving them this evening.""  Okay, no problem really, we were only waiting for 20 minutes after we changed our order. She suggested the catfish bites with fries. BAM! We went with that.  She then explained that they would probably come out shortly before our food.  We were fine with that. She then brought out some corn bread muffins with strawberry butter.  I enjoyed them and the spin on the butter was nice.\n\nSo we waited, and waited, and waited. My glass of water was empty. The waitress walked by a few times and I guess she didn't notice.  No problem, I'll ask.  So I ask for more water.  She says our food should be out shortly. We wait some more.  Finally, the catfish bites arrive.  Now, I usually don't like catfish, it's too fishy for me (if that makes sense), but these were good. Enjoyable enough, nothing to write home about. We asked for more corn bread and more water. \n\nAhhh, finally our food.  So, the lamb chops were SUPPOSED to be parmesean herb crusted.  They were bare, naked as a jay bird in spring!  No problem, I love lamb.  The lamb was tender, that's good right? But didn't taste like anything. I fixed that with some salt and pepper.  I had five tiny lamb chops.  I ate two.  I figured it was a crime to eat them that way.  I decided to take them home and do them proper, season them and place them in the broiler.........just enough to get them a little crisp. I felt it was a shame that I had to take my food home to refix it so it would be good.  Anywho, the BF's waffle and wings were okay.  The wings weren't mom's finger licking good, but crispy and a little tasty.  They got the waffles right, they were cooked through no doughy taste.  The waitress brought out syrup and strawberry butter.  The string beans were good, but a little salty, the yams, mushy with a lot of syrup.  Now, I like sweet yams, but, I don't know how to explain it.  The syrup and the yams seemed separate.  Like they didn't cook the yams in the syrup.\n\nBy the third time asking for more water, the waitress got it. She filled up a pitcher and automatically filled up our glassed. Now, I can only think that they may not be used to customers just drinking water.  I 'on know.\n\nOverall, the dining experience was okay. Nothing to be excited about.  While the waitress was friendly and pleasant, her skill was off.  The food was okay. Having a living social deal helped, which could be why I'm not shaming this place. I may go back, for the prices, I call this a sit at the bar and order appetizers kind of place. It's a shame really, I was hoping to have a ""WOW! Fiesta in my mouth kind of experience"".    Didn't happen. *shrug*",2,kgekOZSsOhjtviiRkqnGxg

Delicious!\nWe ordered 2 sides: tostones with mojo ( the size of the plantains were like saucers) and puréed carrots with roasted coffee- yes you read correctly. Words can't describe the unique and wonderful flavor.\nThe piece de resistance was our dessert. Key lime flan floating on a foundation of toasted marshmallow and graham cracker dust.

If you take out its ambiance and eccentric charms, however, you are left with slightly overpriced, but good, fancy cuban dining. We came to this joint after an exhaustive day at work and were immediately surprised by the sheer height of the restaurant (three flights of stairs). We shared a flight of cerviche, including the mojito shrimp, yellow tail tiradito and the agua chile cobia, followed by smoked marlin tacos, oxtail croquetas, and we shared the lechon asado. My favorite was actually the oxtail croquetas, served over a giant slab of semi-sectioned leg bone with scrappable marrow at your disposal. I tried the classico mojito...it was good, but nothing to extraordinary. The cerviche came in three small bowls, maybe 1-2 bites total and cost about $30 and the two appetizers were about $16 per piece. While the oxtail was worth it, the over-fried fish tacos were definitely skippable. Finally for the lechon...what can I say, it's hard to find lechon, but as Ala de Cuba proved, it's also hard to make it. The lechon was served over a bed of bacon congri rice, but the meat was so salty, and the skin so dry that it felt like chewing on a tree bark.\n\nAt the end of the day, Alma De Cuba is a place that you'd bring your date to impress him/her, but not a place you'd bring your foodie husband/wife. \n\nFood: 3 stars\nService: 4 stars\nPrice: 3 stars\nAmbiance: 4 stars",1,29K-usmZfVDeIaQ85EG54A

Apparently this place is a tourist trap, but it was where we ended up for lunch.  A friend of mine was visiting Philadelphia to try to decide on Penn for grad school (reason #2 for my trip to Philly), and she and her BF refused to leave without having at least one cheesesteak.  Time was of the essence (as was it being within walking distance), and this was the closest option.  According to the shopkeeper at Sugarcube (review forthcoming), these ""were good enough if you don't have time to go to South Philly and try the real thing.""\n\nAnd good enough they were.  The two of them went for the truly artery clogging versions with cheese wiz.  I settled for provolone and pepper.  Was it tasty?  Sure.  But since I can't actually remember the last time I had a cheesesteak, I really don't have anything to compare it to.   And apparently $8 for a cheesesteak is pricey, but to this New Yorker, it was a steal.  It did the job.",2,TLElemg3o3mlA4GGpupNiQ

I spent my college years in South Carolina and was very excited to try this place.  Despite the mixed reviews I gave it a shot.  I ordered the shrimp and grits (my favorite southern dish) only to be told they were out of grits! How is a southern restaurant out of grits? How do they not have the culinary ability to whip up some grits on their own? So instead I got the sauteed tilapia and was not impressed.  The only thing that got this place 2 stars was the corn bread and our very nice server. Not worth it.,4,8adzaPJaLVO8UNGpexN4Yw

At first sight, the interior design was modern and mod. Our server was kind of rude, being that it was our first time here, he acted like we knew the cornbread comes with the meal when I asked about it. One good thing about this place was the cornbread. Warm, sweet, and the strawberry butter made it delish. I ordered the fried chicken, came 3 different ways; wings, white pieces and dark pieces. I opted out for the legs and thighs (dark). We waited about 20 minutes after the cornbread for the main dish to come out. Nice presentation but food was horrible. 2 pieces of chicken, tiny Mac n cheese, and collard greens for $18?! Was not worth it at all. The chicken was toooo crispy. The meat was not seasoned. The Mac n cheese on a scaled of 1-10 got a 0. It was dry, the burnt pieces on top were rubbery and tasted almost old. The collard greens were too salty. Overall a bad experience. Wouldn't recommend this place. Overpriced and crappy food. You're better off going to KFC or Popeyes honestly.",1,XiEkBO-U69VBYqPYGGg1vA

Domo, in Philadelphia PA was a very pleasing sushi experience. I eat a lot of sushi, and this place matches my favorite sushi place in the town where I live. I just happened to be in Philadelphia for the day and tried this new sushi place with a friend in town.\n\nGREAT! We had an appetizer that was out of this world, but for the life of me, I can not remember what it's called. It is a flat egg thing with bacon, chives, fishy thingies, and 2 types of sauces on the top. YUM! Incredible flavors, and a winning combination of things one might not normally cook together.\n\nWe had 4 rolls, a standard salmon roll (very fresh tasting), the ever popular dragon roll (the avacado was super ripe, like melt in your mouth ripe). We ventured to try another roll (sorry my bad memory doesn't allow me to remember the names), which had mango, kiwi, jalapenos, and other flavors too. Like the egg appetizer, this roll successfully melded many different flavors. \n\nMy only complaint was with our 4th roll, the sweet potato tempura roll because the sweet potato was slightly undercooked. \n\nAside from that, the service was excellent, the decor is modern, and they played good music.

My sweetie had the Chicken and Waffles the first time we went and he was very happy with them. The second time, we had the Seafood Platter and it was enough for both of us.  Shrimp were so plump and delicious.  I love how they season their food.  \n\nMinuses:\n1)  The wait, the wait, oh and... the wait.  OMG, we went there on a Wednesday night for dinner and ended up walking to another spot for a drink while we waited for a call back.  He told us 45 minutes and to wait for a phone call.  We never got the call and after waiting the 45 minutes and spending nearly our meal's amount on drinks and chips to hold us over, we ventured back to find open tables and claims that the host called us but we didn't answer.  I still don't think he called.  \n\n2) The music selection.  For such a great place, I think they can afford to add a few more songs to their playlist.  I heard the same tunes on repeat both occasions, months apart.  Maybe they just don't think about it but it's worth exploring.\n\n3) Limited alcohol selection.  I ordered a riesling here.  They were out.  I ordered the pinot noir instead.  They were out.  Eventually the bartender walked over and explained that they essentially had no wines so I just ordered tea.  I can't believe they had NO wine available.  That shouldn't be allowed in such a swanky joint...\n\nAll in all, it's a delicious, somewhat upscale but earthy spot.

We walked in at 1:20pm, knowing they close at 2:30, and we were not greeted and a woman stood up and seemed as though she was going to kick us out. Confused, we sat down and another very sweet, nice woman insisted on waiting on us even though they were closing. That was pleasant, but very off-putting to say the least. We then ordered, but we spent more time waiting for the food to be prepared than we did eating it. All the food was not great but not bad. It was just average. However, my friends chicken sandwich smelled very odd and she found it inedible because of it. It was cheap, which is was pleasing to us, and the woman (I do not remember her name) was very kind, but I don't exactly recommend this restaurant because of that.

We were politely greeted at the door by a lovely young lady and quickly seated and soon greeted by our waitress another lovely young lady. Being as though me and my lady are very familiar with soul food( or as we call it food) from our up bringing and our visits to other restaurants we were pretty familiar with what they had to offer. Although When I attempt to order a Pepsi the server quickly recommended that I try Ms. Tootsies famous Ice tea or the grown folks iced tea which is an alcoholic beverage similar to a long island iced tea. We went with the grown folks iced tea and it did not let us down. The food taste as good as it looks. Now I've read several reviews where people who like myself grew up on this food complained that its nothing special and that there grand mom or whoever does it better. Personally I think that its just a matter of people who have grown up on soul food trying to sound elite in the soul food area; however that is their opinion and I respect it. With that said if you have relatives who cook better than Ms. Tootsie ( which I'm sure some of you do) then please make me a plate because I would love to taste it.

I even took the time to observed the service that others received and it seem to be quality also. The restaurant in my opinion is beautiful, maybe a little dark for some but I liked it. The staff all looked neat clean and professional. My other gripe is Ms.Tootsies is a little on the expensive side but most restaurants of this class are too. A lot of people feel as though its over priced cause they know how to fry their own chicken and bake their own mac and cheese.

This restaurant makes for a great place to sip on mojitos and have some appetizers or indulge in a full fare. I really liked their Big Eye Tuna ceviche, which was prepared with watermelon and thai basil; however, it was only offered during the summer. This past Saturday, we started with the Oysters Rodriguez and loved them. Other appetizers I've tried and like include the Royal Palm Dates, Duck Empanadas, and Kobe Beef Tacos. My favorite entree is the Vaca Frita.  The Lechon Asado is another guilty pleasure. For non-meat eaters, the scallops and sea bass are great choices.",1,3KzTqLBNVCdm_5l5f6Y4zQ

The group consensus was Spanish/tapas, but Amada was already booked and could not accommodate a group of 10 for a Saturday night. After doing my restaurant search, I banked on another Starr creation-- Alma de Cuba (the name is reminiscent of my favorite Cuban restaurant in NYC so my instincts told me to go with this place). It was a good choice indeed. Dining experience was satisfactory from start to finish. The ambiance was ""near"" perfect. \n\nFood: I really wanted to try the Ceviche Tasting but knew that I needed something a little heartier for the Marathon. I decided to go with the Vaca Frita (""fried cow"") upon the recommendation of a friend who frequently dined here. Hearty and crispy (the beef version of a lechon), the entree hit the spot ;) I decided to forgo the beans for the tomato escabeche it came with, which was delicious. Aside from the Vaca Frita, other dishes at our table ranged from the Chicken Combo to the Crujientes (a plantain casserole dish). Menu looks promising. Food was good, but not the best Cuban I've ever had. Save room for the dessert. I was disappointed with the Tres Leches I ordered, which was more like tapioca pudding than the milky spongy sweetness of a TL. Go with the Chocolate Cigar, which was a hit. \n\nWine: The selection was adequate although I would've loved to see more variety in the South-American or Spanish reds (I was not fond of the Malbec I tried and switched to a safer Cabernet-Sauvignon). \n\nAmbiance: Upscale trendy. Great place for large groups. I loved the layout of the multilevel restaurant which was accessible and unobtrusive for the patrons. Mostly white motif blended the sleek modernness of B.E.D. and traditional hacienda-style decor. We were seated in a more traditional room upstairs which was nice. One gripe I had about the decor were the large projections on the wall which I've come to term the ""AdC Mascot""-- man in plantation smoking a cigar. Sinister and out of place, I was uneasy about it at first, but now I've decided I hated it. Could you please remove Mr. smoking mascot from our face? \n\nBottom line: Expensive, but worth it. Good alternative to Amada. Probably the best choice for Cuban in Philly. Great for all groups.",2,AAwtA0p3qXFwaJ25bVsDRQ

And thought I LOVED Rittenhouse Tavern, I was excited to try out the new French menu in one of my favorite venues in Rittenhouse. \n\nI had a relatively easy time making reservations for prime Friday night dinner about a week or so out, which was nice. I pondered why it was a relatively easy reservation, but remembered that the restaurant is fairly new and large at that. \n\nWe were seated right away and had excellent service the entire night from first interaction with the hostess, to the bussers, to our head waitress. The space is identical to that of Rittenhouse Tavern-I have to assume since it's a historical building there isn't a whole lot of leeway for renters to change the decor, nor is there any reason to. \n\nI noticed immediately upon sitting down that we were by far the youngest couple in the restaurant (being in our late twenties). Don't know what that means, but it was an interesting observation to me, anyway. The tables are all very spaced out in the large main dining room overlooking the adorable back patio-I will be looking forward to the weather warming up to try that out, among other reasons. \n\nWe started with three appetizers. My guy had to pick the escargot, I chose a special baked scallop wrapped in spinach, and another special whipped fish ravioli-what can I say, I'm a sucker for the specials menu. The escargot was not all that exciting, honestly, but that's kind of why I didn't choose to order it. Both of the specials were delicious. The baked scallop was perfectly rare and the ravioli were fluffy and flavorful with a light lobster bisque sauce coating them. \n\nFor main courses we shared the arctic char and the rabbit-both were solid. I'm not typically a meat eater but I really enjoyed the rich favors of the rabbit, which included chestnut, small dumplings and foie gras. It was really earthy and not at all subtle. The fish was a perfectly seared portion over a nice root vegetable puree-very good.\n\nTopping off dinner with a nice puff pastry filled with espresso creme and the complimentary macaroons and homemade marshmallow (I think?), we were very satisfied. \n\nNotably, we chose to bring our own bottle, which comes with a $20 corking fee, and we brought a very nice California Cabernet Sauvignon (probably frowned upon in a French restaurant? I don't care), it kept the price tag manageable, about $80 per person including tip. Not a huge splurge but definitely a treat for us. And a very nice one at that.

Over and over again, I saw Campo's on top 10 lists, so it only made sense for us to visit the Old City neighborhood to check it out.\n\nAlthough Campo's is a deli, it's apparently well-known for their cheesesteaks. We dropped by after a Phillies game on a Saturday evening at about 7:30pm and there were a fair amount of customers eating inside and outside, but there were a few tables still available. The restaurant was pretty small, but we were able to get a seat without any waiting. When we walked in, the decor reminded me more of a bar than an actual sandwich shop. \n\nThe menu was actually pretty big and had lots of items on it, but we went straight to the cheesesteaks. There were a few options, but we went with The Works, which was a cheesesteak with sweet bell peppers, mushrooms, grilled onions, provolone. We were bigger fans of cheesesteaks with whiz than provolone so we had the provolone swapped out for the whiz.\n\nThe verdict? The cheesesteak was pretty small, maybe the smallest we had seen yet, so if you're starving this might not be the place for you. There was an OK amount of steak, plenty of whiz on it, but a sparse amount of peppers, mushrooms and onions. The meat had very good flavor on it, mainly because it was saltier. Also, the bread was cold and not warmed up, which put a damper on eating it. The bottom line: Something was just lacking - whether it was because the meat needed to be juicier or the cheesesteak needed to be bigger, that IT factor was missing. Would we come here again? Probably not because of the number of cheesesteak options in Philly. Plus, parking can be difficult to find in the area, since it is located in a very busy neighborhood, and can be expensive at $2.50 per hour via the meters.",3,m1AUK8tI19tUT_N3DMkyIQ

Starting off your wedding here will not only be disappointing, it will disastrous.\n\nI got married on Sunday, Sept 23, 2018. Aiden and I communicated regularly throughout the planning process. The restaurant offers multiple options of set menus, in which my husband and I opted, not only for the most expensive, but also added a few addtional items, because we thought, if our guest are going to make the time to come spend time with us, we have to give them the best. Let me tell you, Chen and I got the best of the worst: a living nightmare.  \n\nWe initially settled for definite 42 tables plus an additional of three vegetarian tables that will be from catering (service charge of $100 per table), with three safety tables, making the total table count to 48 tables. Reaching the date, we were unsure of the amount of people that could make it. Long story short, we asked Aiden if we could cut back, he said no, produce had been ordered. Chen and I decided, we'll take the lost. However, on the day of, not only did our guests completely fill all 48 tables, we needed to set up an additional two tables, which Aiden surely accomodated, granted we were paying for it. This is the only redeeming factor for the mandated one star.\n\nIt is downhill from there:\nThe facility was hot: all of my centerpieces died. My guests were miserable, not because of our presence, but because the lack of food. The food never arrived! A lot of our guests apologized to us, but they couldn't wait any longer and had to leave. At the end of the reception, we settled with Aiden. The ""culprit"" of the delay was due to our addition of ""steamed lobsters"". The kitchen could not accomodate the demand, causing a ripple effect, delaying the process of food. Aiden was charging us an additional $125. The lobsters was the 3rd of 12 dishes, and since the third dish took so long, alot of our guests left before they could enjoy everything else. Aiden reassured us that he has cameras everywhere, and that all the dishes were ready to be served, just did not want to essentially ""skip"" the lobsters, as the guests may be confused. The lobsters arrived, but many had to be returned to the kitchen because it was undercooked. All the dishes that followed were just as sad: the food was cold and as one of my guest puts it: ""the Peking duck bread was as hard as the plate"". Aiden was willing to sacrifice the integrity of nine dishes for one dish, a terrible executive decision that was not discussed with Chen or I, which is demonstrates his sketchy character. More than half the wedding party left, and now I wonder where is their food. Also, my bridal table was not served after I started to do the round table. Though I'm not there, I paid for the food...Hm...\n\nAiden claims he prepared for bigger wedding party, by hiring more staff. However, my guests complained the lack of service. He also claims he was ""blindsided"" (his exact words) that the kitchen only had two helpers, as opposed to the planned three. Three staff members to cook dinner for almost 500 people, 12 courses each table. Hmm no wonder the delay.  OSHA should be investigating the working conditions. \n\nWhile he tried to make amends, he gave us a mere discount of two tables, though we stopped receiving service for half the party so go figure. My husband stepped out, Aiden slyly reassures me that we will be happy because my husband's side ""gave alot of money"" ( They have a tradition of announcing their wedding gifts). I was appalled as his statement: because that is none of your fucking business.\n\nHe concluded our meeting by saying that despite all the ""mishaps"", ""at least the kids had fun"", which was the final straw for me. Fun won't be paying the bills, and fun won't make up for the ruined experience. Not only are Chen and I ashamed, our families felt like we have disrespected our guests and that is something that cannot be changed. Aiden will say he is a better business man than his father, but he lacks integrity. Dictionary.com says a mishap is an unlucky accident, and you called what happen at our wedding a ""mishap"". This was not unlucky: this was poor planning and you basically bit off more than you can chew. Aiden, you not only robbed Chen and I financially, you tainted what was supposed to be the happiest day of our lives. I hope you sleep well at night knowing you also waste a lot of food for all the starving children in the world, and karma work its magic.",9,5jljh5wL6LVm5f8SNb1gQQ

We were still waiting on one person, and they let us know that the whole party must be present to be seated. Once everyone arrived by 8:15 or so, we were still waiting. The hostess behind the counter was not particularly friendly, and she didn't really seem to care about her job. \n\nThe location of the restaurant is a bit strange; it's almost attached to Dave & Buster's, but you really jut have to take an elevator a few floors above. The actual restaurant is very nice and has a gorgeous view of the waterfront in Old City. Once we were finally seated, it took almost another 10 minutes just to get our orders taken. \n\nI had ordered a Hibachi Combo of chicken and NY strip steak. The meal came out in courses. We first got salad, then fried rice, which I had paid to upgrade to noodles. They originally forgot that I had ordered noodles, and I waited another 10 minutes to have them brought out. The Hibachi experience was definitely very cool. Watching the chef do all the cooking was nice, and he was very entertaining and funny. \n\nOnce the main meat course was cooked, I do feel that the portions were very good. I got a very large chicken breast cut up as well as a hefty piece of steak. I do think that's more than deserved, being that the final bill was around 38-40 dollars. I did also have a mistake on my bill, where I was charged for noodles as an entree instead of a 2 dollar upgrade. \n\nOverall, I did enjoy the hibachi experience, and the amount of food was extremely filling.

When Tela's opened down the street it was been the best thing to happen this end of Fairmount.  The combination of quick-casual dining, coffeehouse, market, and pre-made dishes is clutch.  \n\nI've had numerous sandwiches and salads.  All are pretty delicious, but I tend to stick with the Asian chopped salad with chicken or salmon for its simplicity and tastiness.  The place itself is super cute and rustic-homey, with long wooden tables and tiny white lights strung overhead.  Great place to catch lunch, early dinner, or coffee with friends.  Food can take a little while to prepare, so if you're in a hurry order on the app (or call) before you go. \n\nTheir pre-made dishes are all amazing too - we've gotten dinner from there several times.  It's like a wholesome home-cooked meal with no cooking.  Whole roast chicken breast, grilled salmon, braised short ribs, brussel sprouts, kale and mushroom salad, mac and cheese, ratatouille... yes, we've had them all.  Even with a hearty amount for 2 people (usually enough for dinner and lunch the next day), it's usually only about $30.  Not bad for a dinner with salmon, roast chicken, a bit of steak and multiple sides. \n\nFinally, the market goods are great when I'm in a pinch for groceries... especially for produce.  Prices are a little higher than grocery store, but you pay for convenience.  Their dry goods are way overpriced in my opinion - you probably don't need a $7 bag of kale chips or $8 chocolate bar.  But the fresh foods are totally worth it.  And the fresh meats and seafood are amazing... sushi-grade Ahi tuna is superb seared rare.\n\nNot to mention, the owners and staff are very friendly, welcoming both first-timers and regulars.

You never want to get out of them! I never actually ordered room service because all meals were covered. However, the food itself was relatively tasty.

But, I never had any trouble finding food in the Reading Market which is literally a less than a 2 minute walk from the Hotel. \nTheir pool is small. I love their gym. It has good machines and you can get a pretty decent if not equivalent workout there. Guys - please note - obviously if you are the iron-pumping type, this gym will not work for you. \nI also like the fact that you get the newspaper right at your door every morning. It's usually USA Today but I saw the Wall Street Journal in front of few doors (confession - I swapped my USA Today with their WSJ! ) But, I think you can probably request a change in what newspaper you get. \n\nThe downtown Marriot is a big hotel that caters mostly to conferences and such. I'm sure there are people there not attending any conferences, but be prepared to see A LOT of people wearing nametags, etc. If you are looking for a romantic experience, this hotel might not be for you.

There's an awesome openness to the two-story hip and modern take on 70s style dining room. The third level has a bar and an indoor-outdoor dining area deck. During our last visit approximately two weeks ago, the furniture and fixtures looked worn down and dirty. The Continental is a wildly successful concept and there's no shortage of wealth at Starr Restaurants. I'd like to see them allocate funds to freshen the decor.\n\nTuna Tartare (Sesame Crackers, Asian Love Sauce) - 3 out of 5\nThis is my favorite dish at The Continental. The tuna always tastes fresh, is seasoned well, and, at $11, it's a great value. Liberally sesame-crusted crackers, which are shaped like tortilla chips, add a nice nutty richness to the tartare. Obligatory spicy mayo, aka ""Asian Love Sauce,"" contributes a creamy spiciness to the dish. \n\nThai Rock Shrimp Tacos (Grapefruit, Coconut-Peanut Salsa & Sweet Chili Mayo) - 2 out of 5\nI admire the creativity in the flavors here: sweet tropical fruit, hot fried tempura batter, and the spicy mayo all worked together to produce an adequate dish. Few, tiny shrimp were overshadowed by the too-thick tempura batter.\n\nJumbo Lump Crab Pad Thai (Rice Noodles, Tofu, Egg, Scallions & Peanuts) - 2 out of 5\nPerhaps I'm spoiled by the plethora of great Thai options in Philly and the suburbs. I expected an intersection of acidity from lime juice, sweet and nutty peanut sauce, silky richness from the noodles, and a little spicy and zing from the scallions. What we received was an under-seasoned dish that seemed sloppily thrown together.\n\nChicken Lettuce Wraps (Bibb Lettuce & Peanut Sauce) - 1 out of 5\nI was looking for a healthier option for my entree and decided to try the Chicken Lettuce Wraps. The dish consisted of a bowl of chicken and mixed Asian vegetables a la Chinese moo shu; garnished with a side of peanut sauce and a stack of fresh Bibb lettuce leaves. The stir fry mixture was very bland. Similarly, the peanut sauce tasted watery and flavorless. There needed to be a more prevalent peanut taste and viscosity in the sauce. I was pretty disappointed and will not be ordering this again.\n\nOverall - 2 out of 5\nThere are certain restaurants where the food feels infused with love and passion. Unfortunately, the Continental is not one of those places. The plates looked rushed and it felt like the chefs were just throwing food out to sling plates as fast as possible. The food was average and uninspired. There was no delicacy or concern for minor details in presentation of the food nor the appearance of the restaurant. Maybe, after nearly a decade in the city, it's time to re-examine the menu and renovate.",7,tu1XdABnHGNVNguWxdZ_HA

I've been to the one in NYC before and was so chagrined there wasn't one here.  Despite its location down a small side street, it definitely isn't lacking for business.   It replaced Fruit Life and kept most of the interior the same.  In fact, the mural of Hong Kong on the wall was preserved, as was the mural of people eating under umbrellas painted with a ""Mango mango"" logo.  \n\nMy favorite aspect here is the fresh fruit they use for their drinks.  In fact, there are probably more boxes of fresh mangos here (stashed discreetly underneath the staircase) than at the Chinese grocery store across the street where these mangos are likely from (note the telltale purple boxes match the Chinese grocery store's mango boxes).  That being said, the prices aren't terribly cheap.  One Snow White Mango Slush will cost you $5.  That said, the mango tastes so fresh and smells so fragrant that you literally gladly hand over your money.  Mango Mango sort of borrowed from Fruit Life in the sense that they made themselves a sit-down place, which is nice in some way, but you can be stuck waiting for service or someone to notice you when they're busy.

That was 5-6 years ago and I should have reviewed my experiences then but here we are, years later and I am equipped with a more recent trip to my small favorite Fairmount sushi joint. \n\nAbout a month ago I came here on a Saturday night with my boyfriend (his choice after hearing great things about it) for our date night.  With wine in tow, we were seated for our 8pm reservation (an absolute MUST- this place gets packed and walk-in's might have a wait of about an hour if a table opens up) and scored a great spot near the window.  We started off with the half dozen oysters in shell appetizer which were nothing short of magical.  Two of each choice flavored and topped/seasoned with citrus-soy, cilantro-ceviche, and toban salsa.  A truly spectacular dish, refreshing and light, and something that I'll order every time coming back.  We also split some salmon and eel sushi and several specialty rolls, including the 4-8-15-16-23-42, King Kong, and of course -my beloved Godzilla roll which was just as perfect as I remembered it. A great combo of savory fresh fish with sweet strawberries and macadamia bits for a nice crunchy texture. Yum!  A great dinner with great service. \n\nThanks for staying solid all these years, Umai.",5,qESx3c9NOITAcXqTQjbOCQ

The thai shrimp tacos were all right; I thought they were tasty, but had an odd pickle flavor? The sesame flavored spinach was a big hit at our table too; all of the veggie dishes we had were good.

GIANT HEARTS(insert emoji).\n\nThis review is based on two encounters once for a lady date with wine and cheese and the other for the secret supper club. \n\nI met one of my favorite lady pals here a few months  back and we did what we always do... share a cheese board and gossip over glasses of wine. The cheese board was the perfect size  and came along with a few house made accompniments including a TDF quince like paste. The monger asked us our cheese preferences and we both agreed we could do without any blues. The board that came out was pure magic and he even threw in a few slices of a house cured chrozio like sausage. It was a decent size board for two to share and they have boards to fit any size group priced up to 35-40.00. My only  gripe about my afternoon here is the very small and pricey wine list. A few blocks west and a few blocks south one could visit a well known wine bar with alot more options and a better price range for wine. i will pay for delocious grapes in a glass but my sav blanc here rang in at 11.00 and to me its tasted more like an 8.50 glass if that. The seating situation is intense and forces you to be a friendly philadelphian ( even if deep down you hate everyone) Get there at the open of the doors or stroll in after 1:30 or you will be fighting that old couple thats seated at a 4 top instead of  two top for a seat.  My afternoon delight here left me with a four star impression.\n\nI'm always a fan of group dinners and tend to stick with a crew who's down to spend a few shekels more for a great meal. From start to finish the supper club was beyond five start right away. We had a few dietary restrictions at the table , but our server Erin quickly diffused any bombs and the delicious food followed shortly after. 5 courses of well prepared food came out over the course of 3 hours. First the bean dip split between table sections with amazing crackers and warm bread. The salted flour pot bread that came out shortly after made me want to cry it was so good. Our next course was a smoked trout salad again fresh and light prepared and presented so well . The chicken and dumplings ( or extra dumplings for me ) was hearty and filling and the dumplings were so good . Our fourth course was a mountain cheese board and featured La Tur which is pretty much the most amazing cheese that will ever hit your lips. All the accompaniments were prepared in house and the local honey was a nice added touch. Dessert left us all speechless . A mini smorgasbord of decadence. Chocolate chip cookie sandwiches filled with ice cream and rolled in bacon = #sydi and love every bite . Our board also featured a orange scented Madeline , flour less molten chocolate cake and a pine nut square that made me drool.\nService from Erin was spot on. Our group got a little rowdy once the restaurant started clearing out and most peoples beverage pairings were down to drink 4 and 5 .\nI will most definitely be back. Did I mention the house made granola parting gift that made the perfect morning snack the day.\n\nPro tip- so Sunday supper with up to 12 of your foodie friends .

I thought this would be just another ""New American"" restaurant, but Continental manages to be unique enough to make me want more.\n\nHaving lived in Singapore for a bit, girlfriend started out with a Singaporean classic--the Singapore Sling.  It's essentially an alcoholic punch, not too bad.  For food we went with the shoestring fries, seared tuna, and french onion dumplings.  \n\nThe shoestring fries are incredibly addicting and the tangy mustard sauce it comes with only makes them that much better.  While each fry may seem small, don't let their stringiness deceive you, they will quickly fill you up.  The seared tuna, while good, is very pricey at about $18.  Don't think I'd order that again.  The french onion dumplings are greasy balls of deliciousness.  Not only do they taste good, it's actually a lot of fun digging them out of the plate their presented in.  Seriously, try it!  It's really gratifying!\n\nFinally for dessert we ordered the blond bombshell and what a beauty she was.  It's a blondie (similar to a brownie) topped with ice cream, whipped cream, and little chocolate crisp balls.  The serving size leaves something to be desired, but the quality in taste is to die for.\n\nPro-tip: If you're on a date and you want the ""true"" Continental experience, ask for a table upstairs with the ""swinging chairs.""

It could be love, I'm not sure, but there's definitely some lust there. The decor is dark and intimate; with a long bar and a few small tables here and there, this place invites those seeking an intimate date setting or a small group of friends looking to talk for hours over excellent tapas and drink.\n\nYou'll have to forgive my romanticism but having been to Spain a few years ago, this place takes me back. Their tapas, especially the Jamon Iberico and Spanish Breakfast Bite, stand up to what I had abroad (the prices however, do not) and the ambiance transports me. I've been to a few other tapas places in Philadelphia and they do not compare. Jamonera is great for ordering a few of the tapas and sharing with your date or small group of friends. The vegetable tapas board is especially suited to this type of shared meal, giving you a taste of a few things. The portion size isn't terribly large and it can get pricey so I wouldn't recommend this place if you're looking to fill your belly, but rather for a lighter, casual meal.\n\nThe servers were friendly and quick to answer questions or refill your drink. If you sit at the bar the bartender is eager to give food and/or drink suggestions. They run specials on some nights and have a tapas happy hour that I would recommend if you're not quite sold yet.

The staff members were all very friendly and helpful. \n\nNow on to the best part - the food. The first course included 3 appetizers for the table to share. This included a white bean purée w/ crusty bread (It reminded me of a light hummus), spiced papa fritas (crispy fried potato wedges) with a garlic aioli, and manchego cheese w/ almonds & a quince purée. What a way to start, because everything was fabulous! We couldn't get enough! \n\nFor the next course, I had the bacon wrapped, valdeon cheese stuffed, dates.

They serve their food tapas style which is a great way to try a plethora of dishes with the table. The ambiance is quaint and romantic. The service is excellent.\n\nFirst of all, they have a great happy hour with $5 sangria, $6 select cocktails, discounted wines and $5 tapas. Their sangria is the perfect balance between fruit and wine. They have red and white sangria as well. \n\nI have also come here for restaurant week multiple times. Most recently restaurant week in Fall of 2017. With restaurant week, you pay $35 for a 3 course menu, plus at Jamonera, you get a selection of dishes to share. They also have the option of a $25 wine or sherry pairing for which you can choose for each course weather you would like sherry or wine. I selected to have the wine pairing for all 3 courses and definitely wish I would have gone with the sangria. The first course was paired with a sparkling wine, the second with a rose wine that tasted of maraschino cherries and the third course with a red wine that was fruity and medium bodied. None of these wines were spectacular and I am personally partial to the sangria.\n\nFor the table to share, they gave us papas fritas (which are also on their $5 happy hour menu) with smoked garlic aioli and their homemade sherry hot sauce. The garlic aoli is easily the best part of this dish. Its creaminess combined with the tangy sherry hot sauce makes for an amazing combination. They also serve eggplant puree with toasted bread as well as cheese and almonds. The eggplant puree was also amazing. It was a little bit sweet and creamy and tasted heavenly with the toasted bread. \n\nOnto the first course. We ordered the crispy cana de cabra and the mushroom tosta, The cana de cabra was a crispy goat cheese patty with grilled peaches, arugula, hazelnut and fennel. This dish was a great combination of crispy, crunchy and creamy, salty and sweet with a little bit of tanginess from the vinegarette. Would definitely recommend this dish. The wild mushroom tosta was also tasty with a combo of mushrooms, truffle oil and thyme. This dish was yummy but definitely less unique than the cana de cabra. \n\nFor the main course we ordered the branzino and crispy pork loin. Both of these dishes were tasty but nothing too unique. \n\nFor the dessert, we ordered the bread pudding and the peach and plum crumble. The bread pudding was AMAZING. It came with salted caramel, apples and ice cream. If this is an option for you to order, please order it.

The TV wasn't flat screen, but that didn't matter much to me.  The linens were fresh and I especially loved the fact that you can score this place on Priceline.  We stayed on the 6th floor which was a pretty empty as during our entire stay, we didn't run into another person going on the same floor as us.  A downside to our room would have to be the fact that our room was right below the gym's treadmill and weights area.  Totally heard people working out at 5 am during our stay.  The location is perfectly situated right by Reading Terminal and downtown.  If you walk out the main entrance of the hotel, you run into Reading Terminal.  If you walk out the back exit of the hotel, you run into the gorgeous City Hall.  Overall, this is a great place to stay and I would come back.",0,LnZUtFx6qTWs8NV6lAARxQ

I work near by and stop in here for a to go salad a few times a week. When I walked in here for the first time I was a little overwhelmed, I didn't know what line I needed to be on when I paid or if I was on a line to order something else. I think a sign would help because there is often confusion and people asking around me if they are in the right space.  I completely understand that all the ingredients are fresh and are have high quality but spending over 10$ on a just a salad kind of makes me think twice about coming here as often as I do. There are a number of other salad places in the area that I find myself getting pulled towards. But this place is always packed and I love how they are always refreshing the selections. I cant see them actually lowering the price so my only suggestion is a card where you get the 10th salad free for all you're loyal customers that are there weekly!",0,6s7ayDJPOs8qL0IVMyOxvg

Both times, the food was terrific - muscles were meaty and tender in a lovely spicey sauce; the swordfish app had a delicious caper pesto with it; penne amatriciana was perfect; I would happily eat the cacio e pepe over again; sea bass and fried shrimp entrees are both great. No complaints whatsoever with the food - it's the reason I'd go back, for sure. It's very good Italian, with creativity and style. The service was also prompt (moreso on the Tuesday we went) and friendly, without rushing.\n\nThe single, notable downside is the noise. On the Saturday we were there, the place was full, and by the end of the meal around 9 - 9:30pm, the four of us literally had to shout at each other to be heard. Even then, we couldn't always hear. I'm not exaggerating. I know there are folks who like a loud or ""energetic"" atmosphere. If you don't mind shouting at the person across from you, with food secondary to the din, you'll enjoy this. If you want it quieter, our Tuesday night there was much better... even on a Tuesday, by 8pm or so, half the tables were full, and we had to speak up to have ""date night"" conversation. The entire place (except chair cushions) seems to be of tile, glass, marble, concrete, stainless steel -- it looks great but those materials magnify sound. They need sound reduction, somehow. \n\nThey do have a cute outdoor space that is obviously quieter and super attractive. If it hadn't been over 90 degrees in a humid Philly summer, we would have gone outside to escape the noise.\n\nUntil they get some sound reduction, I'm going to stear clear of weekend nights.

We came across this one and it had good reviews, so we decided to check it out. It's definitely not fancy. But it has an authentic feel to it. I liked seeing the meats hanging in the front window along with the cooks in the kitchen preparing the food. My kids had the roast pork, which was pretty good. I had the duck, which was amazing although I wish they didn't leave so many bones in it. I tried the cuttlefish appetizer, but was not a fan. I think I was expecting something different; more along the lines of calamari. It's nothing like that. You've been warned. Lastly, we tried the beef noodle soup. Not good at all. It had an off-putting flavor to it. Not unlike dirty dishwater. And the meat tasted strangely gamey, which isn't typical of beef. The hot tea tasted watered down. I mean, it barely tasted like tea at all. The drink selection is limited. No ice tea, and no diet options. Just the basics, coke, sprite, water etc. So, all in all, this place isn't horrible, but I wasn't wowed by it either. It has its pros and cons. Good for some things, not so much for others. The prices are quite reasonable. Cheap even. I wouldn't necessarily be apposed to eating there again. I would just try my luck with one of their other dishes.

My fiance had left her purse hanging on the chair at the outside table we were eating at. Apparently someone from across the street noticed it and brought it inside. The older gentleman, who we were chatting with while waiting for our food, found her driver's license, recognized her face, jotted down the address and walked it down. She had no idea it was even missing and, needless to say, was thrilled at the exceptional service the man took to make sure she got it back (and also thanks to the passerby across the street). \n\nAnyway, it's not everyday someone goes out of their way to do a good deed for you, and so I just wanted to recognize that on here and say thanks! \n\nAnd BTW, even had that not happened, Garden Fresh would still get a 5-star rating.

I wish I could say the same about Candle 79, Blossom, Millennium, and Ubuntu, some of its upscale vegetarian counterparts, where the food has either been bland, too tough, or derivative on many occasions\n.\n  The food at Horizons is always extremely fresh and truly inventive in both flavor and technique. It's incredible from the warm, melt-in your-mouth foccacia served to each table with the daily infused olive oil to the desserts (and on that note, cheesecakes are a must-have; I still dream about the white chocolate-lavender slice I had two summers ago).   All the spices and textures always complement each other so well. The atmosphere is always pleasant and quiet but never pretentious or stuffy, so you can enjoy the food, conversation, and vegan cocktails made with fresh fruit juices and organic ingredients. \n\nThis restaurant is truly on a different level from its competition and I would recommend it to everyone.

Long after grape street was forced to downsize, and Khyber and Triumph both went out of that sort of business, there are few viable options left and I am still hopeful that the landscape will innovate or at least maintain. \n\nIt would be excellent to see this place make its own name despite where it is right now.  The $20 minimum for credit and guaranteed 20% gratuity may be a slight turnoff to people who like to feel generously if and when buying big meals and tipping 20% or more. Some bar folk just want to have fries and a coke now and again because they already had a meal.  These food/drink minimums would make sense at a crowded, hip scene to make room for paying dinner customers. However, I get easily disgusted by places that have to make up standards like this without inforcing them with a little more effort and class, like why not let the food dictate who buys it and in what quantity?  \n\nAs for the food, it was nothing unexpected for a place that enforces such minimum buys in order to cover fees. This tells me they either forsee a problem with split checks that may be discouraged, or that they have no confidemce anyone could want to buy the fopd if not for a little incemtive. If it were all good enough, I wouldn't need any unwelcome pressures to double up on my appetizer orders, or maybe even ask a few friends to sit with me under the drippy dark wooden roof and run up a tab as we listen to occasional open mic talent, and back bar talk that seeks to drown it out, rather than to respect it for whatever merits it was brought in for, if none other than it maybe being available for cheap, and a good outlet for getting in new customers to try a place they have never heard of because its food has no reputation of its own.  In fact, the manager on duty was the one making the most noise because she had brought her own friends in and tended to them and texting on her phone primarily, instead of summary duties tending the bar and supervising. It was unclear whether she was texting for work or home but either way her focus wasn't in comllete customer satisfaction. She also seemed aloof and disappeared much, leaving a food runner to pour drinks and ring tabs, despite appearing to lack familiarity with the system.\n\nStill, I like the concept of a Philly amateur music scene and as this one has two floors, dedicated to the music, I won't root against it. I just wish the food and service could be more of an attraction here, for those who are paying a full price, 20% gratuity and all.  Restauranteurs must understand that a dessert menu, coffee, entree or drink specials, bottles, and appetizers are what drives volume. Not headcounts and minimum spends.  2.5 stars... could get 3 from me if they had a dessert memu or could do away with the automatic gratuity that they assume is being earned instead of letting the work speak for itself.",1,wWa9X07Cq8EVaqJrA5QKyA

It doesn't seem particularly creative and it just wasn't what I would expect from a Starr restaurant. \n- Lobster Mac & Cheese - I'm a huge fan of mac & cheese and this was very good, but I probably wouldn't order it again.\n- Wasabi Mashed Potatoes - We ordered a side of the wasabi mashed potatoes since I knew they would be good. (The same dish is served at Buddakan.) \n- S'More - I didn't really love this dessert, but I think it's just because I'm used to eating s'mores when they're ooey, gooey, and warm. \n- Pretzels & Beer - The milk chocolate Guinness ice cream was really good! \n\nI will definitely go back for more tartare. I also really want to try to Szechuan Fries and the Seared Tuna. \n\nI would have given four stars but the fact that you're not able to make reservations ahead of time is just SO annoying.

I absolutely love these Cantonese styled desserts and was so excited to see a new place open up to diversify Philly's dessert scene. I had really high expectations, and the interior is beautifully decorated - open, modern, seating both upstairs and downstairs. But it was a bit confusing. To begin, there was no hostess stand, but a line of people waiting for the cashier in the back. I assumed that's where you go to order, but after we ordered and asked where we could sit, the lady said we did it wrong and that we had to sit down before ordering if we wanted to eat there. So, FYI - the line in the back was for to-go orders only. \n\nThe menu itself is extensive. It offers a lot of flavors and different add-in's and combos. It was an impressive selection. I ordered the mango puree juice with mango, sago (which are little translucent tapioca pearls, much different than the tapioca that goes into bubble tea), and pomelo (which is a type of citrus fruit and they separate the cells of citrus. This is the traditional, baseline dessert that is most common in Hong Kong. When we got the order, I was mildly disappointed. It was mainly just the juice. There wasn't much sago or pomelo like there's supposed to be. You had to really fish around the juice to find the pieces. Otherwise, it was still a good dessert and great way to satisfy a sweet tooth.\n\nThe service was just okay.

He came out 2 min later and told me 1 min. The burger and fries arrived 5 min later. So basically 30-35 min for a burger. I figured it would be good!  Took one bite and knew I should've just walked out. Burger had sever char marks from the grill, like the line cook had the temp way too high (probably because they weren't cooking my food and rushed it).  It also was the most bland piece of meat I've ever eaten. The small piece of cheese they put on it was tasteless and the bacon had little to no flavor.

I've already reviewed one Stephen Starr place today, so we'll skip the rant about business tactics and degradation of food costs.  Let's begin...\n\n*Makes fart noise with mouth*\n\nA disappointment is what this place was to me.  For all its showiness and stylish creepiness (2 way bathroom mirrors looking into the bathrooms??), it just could measure up to other places nearby.\n\nLet's look at the positives, first.\n\n1.)  The Look\n\nPhysically, it's a damn beautiful space.  It's like a 50's diner that took all of its best qualities with it into a time machine bound for the 2000's.  The colors all pop and exude fun.  The shag carpeting on the ceiling at the bar is interesting and eye-catching.  Most of all, the seating stands out.  If you're lucky enough to grab one of the tables with swinging chairs, do so without hesitation.  It'll help take your mind off the food later.\n\n2.) The Service\n\nFast and attentive without being over-bearing, the service staff really excels here.  I did have problems with some plate crowding,  but its my own damn fault for ordering so much food after I requested a 2-top just for a swingy chair.\n\n3.)  The Drinks\n\nContinental Midtown boasts a very creative drink list.  An entire section of the menu is devoted to specialty martinis.  I know it's been harkened to a lot on this site, but the Buzz Aldrin is an amazing concept for a drink.\n\nWow, that was glaringly positive.  I guess it's time for an appropriate counterbalance.  Here comes my lone negative...\n\n1.)  The Food\n\nNow, it is entirely possible that I picked each of the worst items on the menu, but even so, they should still be decent to even be on the menu.  To start, I had the humus with pita.  With such a simple dish, I've become accustomed to chefs trying to play with the humus a little.  Truffles, garlic, and red pepper come to mind.  But Continental Midtown offers a plain garbanzo bean humus, something I could purchase in a supermarket for a lot less than this restaurant's pricing.\n\nNext, I went with the crispy calamari salad, having had great experiences with fried calamari in my time.  What I got was unpleasant.  The menu didn't lie, it was served over arugula with sesame oil among other embellishments.  However, the smell of the sesame and the taste of the peanut oil the calamari was fried in overpowered everything else.  I'm sorry, but your fryer oil should never overpower the taste of what it is frying.  In the end, my dish smelled like a skunk and tasted liked peanuts.\n\nFinally, I decided to end with the menu's sole sushi plate, which I think was a spicy tuna roll (it's been a while).  This was actually very good.  But that in itself leads to more questions, like: Why does a non-Japanese restaurant fail in every piece of its menu except for its only sushi roll?\n\nSheesh.  Sorry about the rant, but this is my first overtly negative review, and I had a lot to complain about.\n\nOverall, Continental Midtown fails in my eyes.  It is aesthetically pleasing, but the fact of the matter is that I decided to go out to eat; to have someone else prepare a meal for me knowing full well it would cost me.  Tragically, the preparer of this meal did not hit the mark.  At the end of the day, what is a restaurant if it can't feed people into satisfaction?",3,rxNku8x9n5F68t0RF266yw

You can tell it's been marinating overnight with a very gingery taste to it. My personal favorite is the thousand year old egg congee, a cantonese classic! Loaded with flavor from the congee itself and the egg. The wonton soup was had a clean and soothing broth, which went really well with the duck that was also added on top of it. I personally though the duck was just okay cause it there wasn't much meat in it, but it was fatty and flavorful. The wontons were quite good too because the shrimp/meat inside were juicy and the wonton skin was very thin and almost transparent, which is what you're looking for. The roasted port, but was very tasty and flavorful! How can you not order the roasted pork, when you see it hanging when you walk in the restaurant \n\nAs a Cantonese person, I'd highly recommend this place if you're in Philly! Pretty good authentic and traditional Hong Kong breakfast and lunch food!",2,uVJR-OrTclcZfoNPqqsfYA

A nice fake fireplace in the center of the enclosed area kept it nice and toasty even for someone who has a tendency to feel cold (like me).  We went around 8pm on a Wednesday evening and there was room for all nine of us to relax on the comfy couches.  \n\nI'm not much of a fancy fruity expensive mixed drink kind of girl, so I looked to the beer list.  Although watered down with your Miller Lites etc, I was happy to see that Yards Brawler was on the list (along with Guinness at $7 a pop).

Located just a few minutes from CCP off of Spring Garden, this gem is a must try for all food fanatics. I have had the pleasure of eating here for lunch prior but I wanted to come back for dinner before doing a full review. \n\nThe restaurant is very cozy and classy. It is a small but welcoming space. We ordered Brussels sprout salad, grilled octopus and seaweed salad for appetizers.  For sushi, we had unagi, krakken roll, traffic light roll and pingu roll. For the main entree we opted for the green curry seafood paella.\n \nThe Brussels sprout salad was just addicting. Brussels sprouts have a subtle bitterness when fried so it was perfect with the sweet and sour tamarind dressing. The grilled octopus was tender and when paired with some tossed vinaigrette salad with potato and olives gave such an interesting contrast. The seaweed salad was fresh and flavorful, not part frozen like some places. Our sushi were top notch. The unagi is huge, this is the biggest piece of unagi I've had. The traffic light roll had a bunch of tobiko that added an amazing texture. The krakken roll was a bargain, you have everything from spicy red crab salad to shrimp tempura to fried soft shell crab to spicy aioli and almond bits to top off. It was an explosion of flavor in your mouth. Last but not least is the pingu roll. By far, the most unique roll we've had texturally. Inside, there is cream cheese and soft shell crab. The roll then deep fried and topped off with crunchy potato and eel sauce, it was terrific!\n\nThe absolute show stealer here is the paella. I didn't go to a sushi joint to get paella, that's asking for trouble but I was so curious to see that it was cooked in green curry! I couldn't resist, it turned out to be the best decision of the night. The paella was packed with flavors, you had creamy rice in curry sauce and shiitake mushrooms to mellow out the rich ness. There's the seafood flavor from the shrimp just leaking out into the rice and the fleshy fish just soaking up all that butter goodness. It's so big and we couldn't finish, for 24 dollars it could easily feed 3 people! What a bargain!\n\nThe show could've stopped here and it would have been enough but no, we decided to test the restaurant further. Maybe dessert was this place's Achilles' heel. We ordered funnel cake fries with chocolate fondue. When the dessert came out and we understood. I've always wondered why they called the place Umai Umai, and when we first dipped that buttery, airy but crunchy funnel cake fry into that bittersweet chocolate fondue and tasted our first bite, my taste buds were going ""oooh my, oooh my"". And that! Ladies and gentlemen, is how I will end my review, a perfect five!",1,5uWz5_PITe7Kjfeoo5z77A

I had the roast pork and roast duck noodle soup ($7). I thought the roast pork was better than the roast duck. I went at 8pm on a Sunday and it was totally empty, which was a little awkward and maybe a poor sign. \n\nAs a someone coming into Philly by myself just for a few days, this was a fun spot to check out and was super cheap. I think I would have gotten just the roast pork on rice instead of noodle soup, but I wanted something warm on a cold night. \n\nI think this would be a really good spot if I was working during the week and just wanted to pick up something to go. \n\nThe wait staff were quick and funny.

The atmosphere was great for dining with one other person, as there is a very intimate feel in the small restaurant. When we arrived, we were starving and quickly decided on our food while our wine was opened. \n\nWe ordered the tapas sampler with shu mai, edamame, potstickers and spring rolls. Everything was okay but not very authentic tasting and seemed like frozen appetizers you could get at the grocery store. Additionally, we ordered the yellowtail tiradito, which was light and refreshing with its bold citrus notes. \n\nAs we perused the specialty rolls menus, we were disappointed to see that all rolls had a fruit and/or nut in them. As we were both allergic to some fruits and nuts, we had to think about which ones would still taste good without the way they were intended. Both variables are unique and unconventional to sushi, which can be exciting, but I wish there were some other creative options on the menu that didn't rely on both in many cases. \n\nIn the end, we got Poseidon roll (shrimp tempura, spicy red crab salad, avocado, eel), which was really great, albeit a little difficult to eat with a small pile of the crab salad on the already-large roll. We also got another roll that by now is completely forgettable. Not completely sold on the sushi rolls (and because we were starving), we ordered the scallop entree. Unfortunately, the scallops were not fresh and overcooked so the texture was not that great. \n\nFor dessert we got the green tea ice cream, which was a little grainy from the powder they used. Ideally, I'd like to pretend like I'm not eating a powder mix even if I know I am in the back of my mind. \n\nTo be honest, service was a little slow considering how small the restaurant is, but overall our meal was decent.

I am a fan.  \nI really enjoyed Continental Mid-town, every part of it.  From the instant that I walked inside and saw the beautiful turquoise color furniture and the huge retro chandelier, I felt bliss.  The main floor has big round booths and tables next to the busy Philadelphia streets.  The ambience is casual and has a really cool vintage feel, yet modern.  It seems like a 1960-70's old school fancy airport restaurant.  We were lucky enough to be sat in the upstairs dining area.  The upstairs area is pretty much a huge walkway that goes in a big square around the restaurant with an open middle so that you can see down onto the main floor.   The top floor has tables with wicker hanging chairs and also some booths along the wall.\nWhen we entered the restaurant, we noticed a table with a plate piled like 8 inches high with shoe string potatoes so of course we had to order those.  They had a spicy mustard sauce drizzled on them and were so delicious.  And really fun to look at.  and fun to eat.\nFor our entrees we split the Chicken Tikka Masala and the Chili braised Short Rib.  The Tikka Masala was really, really delicious.  It was perfectly spiced-sweet and rich.  The Chili Braised Short rib was not my favorite but Kyle loved it.  The meat was beautifully tender, but I was not a fan of it being served over refried beans.  \nOur cocktails were absolutely delicious though after having cocktails at two Steven Starr restaurants in one night I'm gonna say that they pour their cocktails very, very weak.

At 1228am I looked at my cell phone that was charging on the night stand.  At 342am I went to check the time and the phone was not there.  I woke up my wife and asked her to check her nightstand for her pone; it was gone as well.  We then realized we had a problem and checked our wallets.  Our cash was missing, but our credit cards and wallet were there.\nI guess we should be glad we did not wake up while the burglars were in our room. Who knows what they would have done to us.\n(When we got home we noticed that our Movie Pass MasterCard were stolen as well. Perhaps this why they did not take our other credit cards.)\nAs we looked around the hotel room, we noticed the front door was slightly ajar.  We then noticed our watches were missing. I immediately called the front desk who connected me to Loss Prevention (LP), and they came up to the room and took a report.   LP called the Philadelphia Police (PPD) for us.  Then LP came back to our and did some kind of mystery test on the door - we were told the test can tell if the door was closed properly and/or when it was opened, or something like that.\nLater that morning, the hotel manager accompanied the PPD to our room and asked if we had called for the police and then the manager promptly disappeared.  The Officer took our report and was pretty startled when we explained that it happened when we were sleeping.  The approx. total of what was taken is $2,000.  After the PDD Officer took our information, he said he would talk to the LP and/or management to gather more information.\nAt different times, both the LP and PPD officers mentioned the door did not close properly.  Later in the morning I went to discuss what happened to us with the manager.  He basically looked at me like I was from Mars - he had no sympathy and wanted to end the conversation as quickly as he could. He not even over to comp us for the night.\nLP forwarded info about our incident to the Marriott Claim dept.  The Claims Dept is telling me since we did not put our phones in the safe WHEN WE SLEEP, it's our fault and tough luck.  \nThe Downtown Marriot has been uncooperative with the claims dept; it's as if they know they were wrong and don't want to give any information. We have heard nothing from the hotel, it's like we don't exist to them.\nDoing some research on Trip Advisor I noticed that another guest at the hotel was burglarized while they were sleeping in Sept 2017.

It was 7:15 on a Saturday evening so naturally it was very packed. \n\nThe downstairs was a trendy diner style seating, but the wait was nearly an hour. So we opted for the rooftop bar instead. We ordered steamed edamame and Korean pork tacos.\n\nThe edamame would have been better if it wasn't cold. We did eat some anyway, because I'm not big on complaining. The tacos were decent, we enjoyed them, but nothing amazing. I did like the shoe string fries with cheese and mustard sauce. It's a different take than I've personally had before, but you definitely need a fork and napkin. Would order again.\n\nAs for drinks, I got an Aperol spritz and my friend got the Prosecco Punch. Pretty decent, we were happy. Round two: Perfect Pear and another Prosecco Punch. The Perfect Pear we both nearly coughed trying it. It was so sweet. I had to add water to make it tolerable. It could have just been the bar tender with a heavy syrup hand this one time. Because I've seen a couple ppl quit enjoy theirs. Last drink, two Prosecco Punches----we were happy. \n\nThe bartenders were nice. Worked quickly and were pretty attentive for it being packed.\n\nIn all: we would go back, but it's not high on my list.",0,QdIVkG5MrEWmoG31gc97Ig

An order of the tacos only comes with 2, however they are quite filled with meat. Note : they do have a spicy kick to them! We were thrown off by the spiciness at first but were juicy, tender, and flavorful. The Philly cheesesteak egg rolls were SO filling. They're not the size of your traditional egg rolls- these boys are thick (probably 2 inches or so in diameter) and the egg roll wrapping is pretty thick, filled with cheese, meat, and bell peppers, served with a Sriracha ketchup to cut the fattiness . I was skeptical to order them at first because I saw a review saying they were really dry, but I didn't have that issue at all- the juices were oozing out of them with every bite I took.

The shaved ice came in a HUGE portion that my friends and I weren't expecting. The four of us barely finished half it (but keep in mind we also ate the crepe cake and mango juice dessert). The shaved ice was a little bland, and some of the mango chunks were a little hard and sour. However, we also went in January and I'm sure it's hard to get perfectly ripe, juicy mangoes all the time. The mango juice with ice cream was my favorite. I was skeptical of the ""mango juice"" aspect but it reminded me of mango italian ice or a mango slushie.

Confusing I know! Anyway I've had lunch at the Pret/30th Street location several times and I've never visited the Locust Walk location, I wish I could move my reviews over to this location. I'm using the yelp app not the yelp website so I guess it will remain as is but here's a summary of my review of my Pret experiences at the 30th Street location.\n\nCustomer Experience\nService 5/5 \nBUT...caveat, it's uneven - there may only be one person at the register during high volume times of the day but the lines move fast and the staff is well trained. At the beginning there were a few glitches and even now I've noticed staff shortages but they transition smoothly and everyone Is very nice! This 5/5 rating is for staff members not for the right amount of staffing during the different points of day.\n\nSignage and Experience 2/5\nSignage needs to be bigger and if the menu changed often (which it does) they need to consider using large monitors with changeable signs/menus b/c you have to do a lot of reading and other people maybe waiting behind you. This location is in a train station, they need to make more and bigger font  signage so people can know what's available, where it's located the price and the calories without having to pick up the product and read it. I don't want ten+ people handling my pre-packaged lunch do you? Everyone is very patient but if Pret posted a large menu monitor somewhere away from the self serve chillers and heaters and made the signage bigger at the self serve chillers and heaters area, the choice process would move faster and people wouldn't feel annoyed or pressed for time. \n\nMenu 5/5 \nMost everything offered at Pret is pre packaged and seemingly healthy. I'm not a dietician but I am a seasoned dieter, albeit badly: I know what the calories, fiber/fat/protein/sugar content should be. They offer hot and cold pre packaged soups, Mac n cheese and cold salads sandwiches and composed platters as well as little cups of breakfast type parfaits and portioned lunch snacks that are bigger than they look. The only items packaged as you wait are the pastries which look divine. When Pret first opened, I thought the prices seemed a bit steep . But now that its neighboring competition raised its prices, Prets prices don't seem as high anymore. \n\nFood 5/5\nI've tried several items at this location including but not limited to the following:\n\nThe Mac n cheese with spinach and tomatoes 5/5\nIt is a nice size portion for about 440 calories not low cal but not overly high cal and it was delicious- it contains cauliflower which makes it seem richer than it really is. \n\nSpinach and artichoke Mac n cheese 3/5 it's not as tasty as the aforementioned tomato n spinach version, watch out they look similar.\n\nThe feta tomato soup 2/5 BUT...\nThough it was too sour for my taste, other people LOVE IT!  I won't be ordering it again. \n\nI enjoyed the turkey chili 4/5\nSo like I said it's all pre packaged so I would not have ordered it if I'd seen it first b/c there is corn in it. I avoid corn in soup. But even though I don't love corn in soup, it was tasty and it was under 400 calories for the large portion. I'd consider ordering it again b/c it's turkey chili not beef. Though it was a bit too salty for my taste, and I can get beef chili from Wendy's right across the way; I'm really watching my beef consumption; so I may opt for the corn laced turkey chili a la Pret.\n\nMoroccan lentil soup 5/5\n Bestie loved the Moroccan lentil soup, she said it was the right thickness and flavor and it smelled divine. And it wasn't too salty; I can't stand overly salted soups so it's a good recommendation.\n\nEgg salad & watercress sandwich 5/5 \nIt's a thin sandwich- if you're very hungry I suggest adding another item or some other accompaniment. This sandwich was very affordable for 30th St.\n\nSalmon on salad  greens 5/5\nA nice size portion of salmon served over a bed of mixed greens and other veggies. It was delicious and very filling. It seemed like a healthy choice, so for those at war with their health and weight, this is a good choice. :)\n\nThe show stopper: before tasting the following, I'd have said it was the spinach and tomato Mac n cheese but WAIT THERES A NEW ITEM:\nThanksgiving Harvest sandwich 6/5 \nStanding ovation please!

We met at 5:30 pm without a reservation and when we saw how packed the restaurant was, I immediately started scrolling through my Yelp bookmarks on where to go instead. Fortunately, the super kind host told us that a group of four had not shown up for their reservation so we were able to snag their table. SCORE! We definitely lucked out. Moral of the story: make sure to book a reservation ahead of time if you plan on heading to Jamonera. \n\nI started the evening off with a Roja Sangria. This absolutely delightful sangria was made with Spanish red wine, apple brandy, rosemary, and orange. I had gone back and forth between the red and white sangria and am so glad I decided on the red. I would definitely get it again. \n\nAs for tapas, my boyfriend and I decided on the Mushroom Koka and Gambas. The Mushroom Koka was a flatbread pizza with sautéed wild mushrooms, urgelia cheese, and arugula-almond pesto. It was very flavorful and perfectly crisp. I really enjoyed it. The Gambas came with four shrimp, a potato-apple pancake, and brown butter pepita sauce. A satisfying dish, although I'm not sure if I would get it again. It was good, just not THAT good. \n\nAs for pricing, drinks can range from $9 for a sangria to up to $12 for a cocktail. The food can go up as high as $27 for an entree. If you're looking to make a full meal at this restaurant, they advise you to get 1-2 dishes per head.\n\nAlthough I did like the tapas I tried (especially the Mushroom Koka), I was more impressed with my drink. My friends ordered cocktails and seemed to really enjoy their drinks as well. I'll probably head to this place again at some point, but I'm more likely to go for just drinks or during happy hour than for dinner.",15,kTpsjDUhl9BlRl0FVuNreA

Please do yourself a favor and instead of ordering them a la carte, go ahead and ""order a pitcher."" \n\nPINK GRAPEFRUIT burnt sugar, mint, honey $4.50.  Quite deliciouus.

It is relatively simple too.\n\nBENEDICT canadian bacon, hollandaise sauce, toasted english muffin   14\n\nENGLISH BREAKFAST two eggs any style, cumberland sausage, black pudding, tomato, mushroom, smoked bacon, fried bread, baked beans   16\n\nPlease also do yourself a favor and get a side of Applewood Smoked Bacon.

I can forsee this dessert sticking around for quite awhile.  Tasted amazing.  \n\nSTICKY TOFFEE PUDDING  vanilla ice cream.  This was also pretty good.  Can't go wrong here.

I arrived early so I sat at the bar.  The bartender let me sample all 3 of their cask ales and I ended up going wit his original recommendation.  While I waited, I asked him what his favorite thing on the menu was.  Without delay, he said ""the chicken and duck liver parfait.""  Fortunately, when my friend arrived, she agreed to try that.\n\nWe ordered oysters, deviled eggs, the parfait, the pint of prawns and the beet cured salmon.  The oysters were delicious and fresh, not very briny.  The deviled eggs were just right and had a hint of curry and cayenne in them.  The pint of prawns was closer to a shrimp cocktail but the shrimp were done perfectly.  I really enjoyed the salmon, along with the dill and crème fraiche that it was served with.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the parfait, but the portion was very large.  They give you three slices of brioche which is clearly not enough.  We even ordered a second batch of brioche and it still wasn't enough for all the parfait.  It's very rich and I recommend having it, but maybe splitting it among 3 or 4 people.\n\nThe layout and decor of this place is really cool and I can see myself stopping back in here for drinks and a bite to eat.

Upon digging into the french toast, however, I noticed that some parts were way too eggy and soft (undercooked) while other parts were very crispy and dry. There was no consistency at all in their preparation of the dish. The entire french toast was sitting in a huge pool of maple syrup, and the entirely soaked bottom was way, way too sweet. The whipped butter seemed to be a nice addition, but it just contributed to the toast's unnecessarily high sugar and fat content.\n\nMy friend ordered some sort of eggs Benedict with lox.

And our cheerful server didn't bat an eye when I chose to drink the coffee I had brought along (again, anticipating a wait) instead of ordering theirs.\n\nOur chief reason for visiting Cafe Lift was the cannoli French toast, and when my husband saw the seasonal version (pumpkin, maple and walnut) he would have done a round of handsprings if he'd had any idea how. I like a bit more protein for breakfast, so settled on the corned beef hash. While we waited, we took in the decor, a nice fusion of rustic and modern. It was also nice to be on the mezzanine level; we had a nice view of the drizzly street below.\n\nPlates arrived fairly quickly, and we dug in. My hash was a great combination of tender corned beef, cannellini beans and roasted cauliflower and broccoli romanesco (sort of a broccoli-cauliflower hybrid) topped with two eggs over easy. It reminded me of a dish my mom makes, Napa Valley Beans, but this had less substance -- there weren't many vegetables, and it really needed some cheese to hold it all together. Still, I ate it without complaint -- it was hot and flavorful, and I was hungry!\n\nMy husband attacked his cannoli French toast, and I stole a couple of bites. It was expertly prepared, with eggy bread and warm maple syrup and crispy walnuts and creamy ricotta (it was much more watery and light than cannoli cream, I guess from the addition of the pumpkin.) The crumbled chocolate on top was just too much for me -- I don't love super-sweet and rich foods in the morning.\n\nDuring our meal, we had some interesting interactions with the staff: the manager came over to ask how our meals were, which we appreciated, and the hostess amused us by doing yoga-like moves from her post whenever there were no incoming customers. I don't mean surreptitiously stretching a leg or two; I mean full-on Warrior One in the middle of the restaurant. We weren't offended, but we did giggle a little.\n\nIf we're ever in the area again, I'd love to try one of their more pedestrian entrees; it could be we were just too adventurous this time around!",1,ENSYT8atZM8gus_xXDzzJQ

The staff are super friendly, the decor and ambiance was on point but ultimately it comes down to the stuff I shove down my pie hole. In other words, the food.\n\nI just need to start off by asking why on earth the main photo for this place is a guy with his arms crossed. I don't really think that's a good/appropriate representation for The Dandelion and I find it very distracting. There's probably some really touching and depressing reason for it so I'll stop now before I embarrass myself.\n\nLet's get on with it, I came here with a friend on an early Sunday afternoon. Considering how well-known this place is, I was shocked that there was absolutely no wait at this time in the middle of the summer on a BEAUTIFUL day but ok, sure, I'll take it. \n\nWe follow the hostess upstairs and are seated in this charming little corner. I mean charming in the same sense of the word as when it's used to describe a tiny apartment in a back alley overlooking the dumpsters. We were like all up in the grill of this large party sitting next to the window. Their food looked so fucking good and it was so picturesque, the whole scene, that I almost took a photo but ultimately decided against it bc that would just be creepy af. Not that that ever stops me.\n\nWithin moments of being seated, our waitress came over. Like it was so fucking speedy that we barely had a chance to open the menus to take a look. I don't like to waste valuable daylight waiting to order a beverage so I had to make a decision on the go. The bottom left corner has the brunch drink specials. Both my friend and I went with something Queen Royale or something bloody mary. I just went to the menu on their website to try to find the exact name for u and I discovered two things that devastate me. 1: they have afternoon tea and I'm writing this review based on their brunch and not on their afternoon tea and 2: they have a chocolate stout??!? WtF? \n\nFor food I ordered the spinach and ""smoked cheddar"" omelette WELL DONE as always and my froynd got the royale eggs benedict. \n\nThe bloody mary was on the better side of what I usually experience but I'm usually disappointed with bloodies and this didn't knock my socks off. I did enjoy the pickle chip and that giant green olive. \n\nMy beef with this place, and the reason why three stars, is because of the food. The omelette wasn't well done like I asked, at least to my liking. It was also extremely thick so the inside was a bit liquidy. The cheese might have contributed to the liquidy-ness but I wasn't keen on the texture of the omelette in general. Also the cheddar wasn't smoky in any way. I actually didn't even taste the cheese at all. There was like 2 leaves of spinach. The side salad was fresh and dressing was applied heavily (a plus). Unfortunately there were itty bitty something in the onion family so that detracted from the flavor for me. Also, good for my diet/thighs but where were the potatoes? Brunch eggs as a standard usually come with potatoes or toast or SOMETHING along those lines. Not here.\n\nMy friend loved hers though, stay tuned for her review. Unless she posted it already. One of the poached eggs' yolk was solid. I'm not a benedict expert but I don't believe that is how it's supposed to go.\n\nOk I'll wrap it up, relax. The scones looked fucking delicious and the desserts were extremely tempting but like I said before, diet. Also the mac and cheese someone at another table got looked literally divine to an almost sexually arousing degree. I feel tempted to come back here to give them another chance.\n\nOk, I have to go make sure my slow cooker didn't explode, bye.",1,oR5az_eNCnfN7e49H3ONhg

This is a large noodle dish arrayed with lots of mussels, calamari (not grilled), and shrimp. The flavor profile was excellent: garlicky, sweet, savory, herbaceous, and delicious. However, the shrimp and the spaghetti were poorly executed. The shrimp was overcooked, dry and too tough. The spaghetti was just a bit undercooked (should have sat an extra 90 seconds in simmering red sauce). The pasta is, unfortunately, dried box/bag pasta. \n\nFor dessert, the Tiramisu was excellent.

The meat of the tacos had an odd seasoning and tasted like it was cooked a few days ago.  It also wasn't the right texture i.e. carne asada.  My boyfriend's burrito was the worst though.  About 90% lettuce, very skimpy on the other fillings and, like another poster mentioned, there was a cheese in there that resembled white Kraft singles.  Ugh!  The rice and beans were nothing special, the beans had that weird stale taste that my tacos had.

They put a note next to our reservation so that when we got there, our waiter already knew that there was going to be a vegan at the table.  Then, one of the guys who worked there (the manager, perhaps?) came out to tell me each item on the menu that could be made vegan- there were several, which made the choice very difficult!  I ended up getting the brussel sprouts with pine nuts (without the cheese) and a pasta dish that was delicious.  The waiter was sure to let me know that everything would be cooked in olive oil and not butter and that the pasta that I ordered wasn't made with eggs.\n\nGiven how accommodating and friendly they were, I have to give them 5 stars.

No definitely a little over-priced, but that probably keeps people away and I like the quiet coffee shop vibe.\n\nExcellent cappuccino (clearly made with love and LOTS of foam = beautiful and delicious). I want another.\n\nCroque Madame: Alright/most disappointing part of the meal. WAY over-salted/peppered. Like, I gagged status. Scraped off the top, and then it was all good. Totally thought it was made on white sandwich bread (yuck!) until I was most of they way done until I realized it was French bread that was shaped to LOOK LIKE white sandwich bread. WHY??? but whatever. Mixed greens does not equal romaine lettuce, but whatever again! Overall, tasty minus the INTENSE seasoning.\n\nCrepe was delicious, had a few bites of one, next time I will get that instead.\n\nGirl at the counter was super friendly and deserves a raise.",0,V_aUJaHsqMYbmenrQcHsfA

I got huevos rancheros as per another Yelp recommendation and I was blown away by the flavors, especially their homemade hot sauce that they serve on the side gratis.

Highly recommended.\n\nGirlfriend got a plate of pancakes, in which the kitchen graciously folded fresh blueberries, served with fresh strawberries on the side and a generous portion of perfectly sweetened homemade whipped cream.

Definitely recommended for the table to share, but it might be too much for a single person to order.\n\nThe rest of the crew got eggs benedict, eggs florentine (on special), and a panini of some sort.

I substituted the mozzarella cheese for fontina for more flavor and fresh asparagus studded the egg dish. The frittata was cooked perfectly without being tough and the pesto was so fresh and flavorful.\n\nThe LEMON RICOTTA PANCAKE photographed beautifully, but was kind of disappointing. The batter lacked lemon zest so it didn't pack enough citrus punch to offset the creaminess of the ricotta. \n\nThe EGGS FLORENTINE with CRAB and TRUFFLE HOLLANDAISE was very good, but my the hollandaise was seriously lacking in truffle flavor.

8pqdJjefYq-a9IBSJJmKwA,9,2011-01-22 16:08:50,7,j8sbcNBaGy0GaaXfOzFRFg,3,"We came here last night and experienced many of the acclaimed ""just-opened"" jitters. To start, earlier in the week we tried to reserve a Friday evening table for six and were told no, that we should just show up the night of when we would only wait about a half hour. Came, left a phone number at the stand, popped down the street for some less costly suds (inside the lion's bar was uncomfortably packed) and an hour and a half later we still hadn't been called. Finally got through to them and were told to come right over, but now our 7PM meal had a 9PM start. More mix-ups as the night progressed, but that triviality is hardly worth mentioning (especially since the things they forgot were free when they finally came). \n\nWe had apps elsewhere due to the wait, so entree orders were the majority of what was placed. Food came staggered, but it was at least very tasty to me. I got the Welsh Rarebit, which had a strangely good mustardy-cheese flavor (strange because I tend to dislike mustard), and the subtle taste of the bread just capped off it's gooey goodness. Moved onto the lamb Shepard's pie, and it's flavor was great; a perfect dish for the bitter cold night with an excellent meaty sauce, a good amount of creamy mashed potato, and a cheese crust on top that was not overly thick (bonus, no peas!). The glutton in me could have torn up a pie twice as big as the one that came, but the average person in me finished the meal full and content. I also tried my GF's chicken and it was quite good; cooked perfectly so that it was tender and moist, and with a mellow thyme sauce that really helped the dish out (sauce could have packed more of a punch, but that's just because I dig a strong dose of thyme flavor when I get down on it). \n\nThe other diners ordered the cheese plate and a few burgers with mixed reviews. Three did not like the cheese for the burger, and of those, two didn't like the pepper slaw (going so far as to describe their feelings towards the burger as a strong hate). The cheese plate was cool, with a mix of non-dairy items that would normally set off such a dish (quince slaw, apple slices, apricot, grapes...), but the three cheeses were actually a little boring; White cheddar, yellow cheddar, and blue cheese? I get a better variety in single slices when I raid my mother's fridge. \n\nBeer, which was an appealing factor for me to come here, was a tad disappointing. Last night was my first sampling of cask beer, and it was okay with that whole room temp. thing (at least on a low teen January night), but I really like the tiny bubbles in my wine, so I switched to the 7% Yards IPA draught (?draft? That spelling always gets me) and started feeling much more happy, and much more fine (helped me forget that i was paying $5+ for 8oz.-O-suds, and then $9+ for 16oz.). Generally, it seems they have 3ish casks, about 6-8 draughts, and then a good 15 bottles/cans, but the choices didn't really float my boat (or the prices). \n\nIt's a Stephen Starr joint so, if you are familiar with any of his spots, you pretty much know how you'll like it before you walk through the door. Speaking of walking through the door, if you are there for dinner, bypass the downstairs pubbery, the suited up tough with flashlight at the base of the stoop (don't be scared, his job is to shine a light at your feat as you de/ascend the steps while also keeping said steps clear), and head right to the second floor to find the host stand, else the diners arriving after you will almost certainly one up you in the seating order. \n\nIf I am dropping bucks (even though someone else treated me) I want to be wowed, so I doubt I'll return, but maybe someone will pick up the tab again, so who knows.",10,Y-4RCXXrQ8hS5bR5uTp48Q

The beer selection is awesome, I think there are like 4 cask selections and 6-8 draft. I had the Yards English-Style IPA which was fantastic. \n\nThe food however (I am also only speaking of the food we had ordered) was not that impressive. In my opinion, the food tries too hard to be ""unique"" in the English Gastropub concept. I had the fish and chips, the fish - perfectly battered and cooked, nice flaky white fish = delicious. The chips - it was like one potato cut into 4 sections brined and deep fat fried - undercooked in the middle = not good. My wife had the mac and cheese. The mac and cheese would have been great if it didn't consist of 60% pork. Yes that's right more meat than mac and cheese = gross. This truly should be menu-ed as ""Braised Ham hock Served with Mac and Cheese"". \n\nThis is one guys opinion here, you may be a fan of Wawa's mac and beef - in that case try an elevated version here and if your into super thick cut fries then you will be totally happy with the ""chips"" here. Not me, but I may be back to have a pint and try the burger (sans the chips).",0,3fERvunOO5LMwE2eIKSFug

I made the reservation Open Table and mentioned that it was my boyfriend's birthday.  So when we walked in the host greeted us and wished him a happy birthday.\n\nThere are two rooms, downstairs and upstairs.  We were sat upstairs but there was a bar downstairs and a large table downstairs and upstairs for groups.  The ambiance is cozy, modern and romantic.  Candles are lit on each table and the room was dim.\n\nOur server, Kevin, was excellent.  He was very informative but also down to earth. After explaining the menu he also explained the drink menu and special pasta menu, where you get several courses of pasta and dessert for a set price.  If you are interested there is also a sommelier available to help you choose wine.\n\nEach table receives a basket of bread and butter in a small pot.  The bread was fantastic!  There were several different kinds, all crispy, light and warm.  Traditionally, you should order an appetizer, first course, and second course.  We shared Ravioli di Ricotta e Verza, swiss chard and ricotta filled ravioli with chanterelle mushrooms and truffle butter.  The ravioli were light and airy, similar to eating a buttery, savory, pillow of air.\n\nAs a main course I had Black Bass ""Gamberetto"", roasted filet with ruby red shrimp, creamed spinach and sopressatta.  The bass was cooked perfectly and was quite delicious.  My boyfriend had Pollo al Mattone, brick-roasted half chicken, brushed with mustard and rosemary bread crumbs.  The chicken was juicy and the mustard gave it a unique zest.  Overall, I'd say the main course was up to Stephen Starr standards.\n\nFor dessert we tried some gelato: double chocolate chip, vanilla and cinnamon.  The gelato came out in a dish that had 3 separate compartments with each of the flavors separated.  Along with the gelato came a plate with biscotti, some kind of iced cookies and said happy birthday written in chocolate.  Oh, there was a candle in the gelato as well.  After we dug in, the manager brought us a traditional Italian dessert, affogato, which was a martini glass with vanilla gelato and whipped cream.  He then poured hot espresso in the glass and it melted the gelato and made it deliously creamy and a perfect way to end our meal.\n\nIf I had to pick the best part of the restaurant I would say the service.  Everyone went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and tend to our every need.  My boyfriend was wished happy birthday multiple times and it really made the difference that they cared.  And again, Kevin really made our night special and fun.  I will definitely be back and recommend it to anyone!",1,Qe-5XKTEasY9eHRbUeKXdg

The ingredients were fresh and tasteful.\n\nSo here's what we ordered: The Deviled Eggs, the Welsh Rarebit and The Chocolate Hot Pot.\n\nThese were the best deviled eggs we'd ever had. The spiciness of the curry and creamy yoke with the firm well boiled egg white, just perfect. And at a pub special of $2, you can't go wrong. The rarebit was a close cousin of French Toast.

Pair that with a dark & stormy cocktail, and you've got a little piece of heaven. I wasn't convinced by the caramel chocolate tart until I combined it on the spoon with the praline ice cream and candied pecans.

Naturally, this led to me waking at an absurd hour.

Inside, I discovered a catholic assortment of caffeinated beverages ranging from the expected frothy cappuccino to the unusual Vietnamese Iced Coffee. Already wired from my morning drink, I opted for an unsweetened Black Forest Berry tea. \n\nWith a menu encompassing crepes from the savory to the sweet and a pastry display offering almond croissants, chocolate croissants, French tartes, bagels, and biscotti, I was not without options. In a sprightly healthy mood, I opted for Le Legumes Vegetarian, hold the avocado. Knowing that my French was too broken to continue conversation, the kind man behind the counter asked what I would like to substitute instead of avocado. Delighted, I replied, more leeks please.\n\nAnd I sat, sipped and waited for my crepe to be delivered to my table. The door jingled, and just as my buckwheat creation was placed before me...in walked Beauregard-Pierre...6'2"" with a soft mop of brown hair, strong arms and a charming smile. He lifted his sunglasses, peered at me, strolled over to the counter and ordered: a bolognaise special crepe and an orange juice. \n\n...and thus Beauregard found me...and I found not only a delicious, crisp buckwheat crepe fat with leeks, spinach, and mushrooms, a tea so fresh and fruity that it were it not for that unsweetened tang, could be confused with juice, but also a fine dining partner and...well, the rest est l'histoire.",5,VEj1OuO6QrQMXFhuMZJ8cQ

However I have very dedicated quizzo playing friends so they are in here weekly for a game and sometimes I tag along.  The decor is very cool, bits of Americana on the tables with some foreign accents.  It isn't overwhelming so the place doesn't come off like a TGI Fridays.  I've had some of the foo and it was all tasty pub food, the fries are particularly good.  The beer list is a little weak, but again I am picky.  I usualy get the DFH 60 min or the Ugly American APA, which I think is a rebrand of Yards Philly Pale Ale.  I have never seen them rotate in different beers which is really my only big complaint.   Service can be a bit slow, there is only one server for the whole place and it gets packed during quizzo.  So drink orders and water refills can take a while.  The kitchen works fast though and food comes out quick.  The server is always the same and seems like a nice guy, so I would say he just gets swamped sometimes.  I have had friends order the wine and it seems like it is always fresh.\n\nOverall it is a decent pub, if you are a looking for some straitforward pub food and a beer its a good place especially if you are a local.  I wouldn't see any reason to go out of your way to come here since I am sure every neighborhood has some place like this",0,YKubepkxyPpL6pkz5FO8Fw

It's not that big of a restaurant, but I've never seen it get uncomfortably crowded. Between the size and the ambience, you can't help but to feel kind of like you're at home.\nMama Palma's is byob and as for the food, I've heard a few people label them as the best brick oven pizza in Philly... Unfortunately, I cannot agree with that statement. I'll start off by saying they with out a doubt have the best polenta bread in the world! Trust me, there is no competition to that. But the pizza pies just don't measure up in my opinion. The specialty pies definitely get an A++ for presentation... They use the freshest ingredients that you can find, but my issue is with their red sauce pies... The sauce is extremely mild and regardless of what toppings we got, the sauce just seemed to make everything taste bland (my friends though the same as well). But luckily, that's not the case at all with the white sauce pies. The Primavera with goat cheese added is by far my favorite! We also had a Caesar salad, which was a little disappointing to all of us. It was just Romaine with grated parmesan cheese and average croutons. Some of the Romaine was borderline wilted and it was just a disappointment because it didn't look nearly as appetizing or fresh as their pizza does... For the same price, some of Mama Palma's competitors Caesar salads come with huge shavings of fresh parmesan cheese and more/ better seasoned homemade croutons. Another thing that Makes Mama Palma's lose a couple of points in my book is that they don't deliver like some of their competitors do. All in all, they have some things that are great and some other things that I don't care too much for. They're definitely worth a try, especially if you're dining in.

When you go upstairs , you'll find a open space seating with a dance floor and a mini bar.  \n\nThe only downfall to this place, there isn't s specific age range.

It has kind of an artists studio look with exposed industrial touches. I would believe it if it used to be an old warehouse. I realized the tables were too close together that further emphasize how packed we were. You can hear conversations from both sides!\n\nBut getting on the food. The menu looks great! Everything sounded so delicious. I was stuck between the mushroom frittata and the huevos. I chose the frittata, my bf got the breakfast burrito which he loves. We ordered a side of sausage and lemon ricotta pancake to try. \n\n\nFood took long to come out which is understandable for very busy morning brunch hour. They actually forgot our pancake until we nearly finished our meal, apologized and put it on the house which was a nice touch of them to do! Philly people are so nice! But unfortunately it was not memorable. It was light and fluffy in lemon flavor but ricotta to batter ratio was too low. \n\nThe BF's burrito was good! But too little cheese! On the other hand I didn't realize my frittata had Italian bacon on it(which I don't eat) and instead of sending it back to be remade and starve, I gave it to my bf but still didn't feel as satisfied with it as I hoped to be. It was decent because I like eggs but I feel it was missing something. Maybe a variation in bite. The texture was a-okay, not too soggy but lacking in flavor. I would've made it with onions and fresh green bell peppers for a little more interest. (I make mean a frittata btw!) the home fries were absolutely delicious though!\n\nIt was an Eagles game day and everyone and their moms had their Eagles pride on! It was funny seeing a whole lot of green that wasn't the Jets.\n\nI would most definitely consider hopping on a 2 hour bus ride from NY to come back to Philly just to try the rest of the menu.",2,mOoF5p630jSbcZfuZQ30Gg

Working with the event planner Kerri was extremely easy, she certainly made it stress free, and we got a 3 course meal for $35.  When we arrived, we were escorted upstairs to a large table they had reserved for our group.  There were custom menus printed up and had one at each table setting.  The staff was excellent at making sure that everyone got their drinks and food at the same time and clearing the table between courses.  \n\nAs for the food, I chose the rarebit to begin with, which was cheesy and flavorful with a slightly mustardy bite to it.  It was very good, but I couldn't finish it, especially knowing I had two more courses coming.  I got to try a bite of my friend's terrine appetizer which was phenomenal.  The main course choices were the shepherd's pie, the roast chicken, and the macaroni and cheese.  I opted for the macaroni and cheese and after tasting all three, I'm convinced mine was the least favorite of the three.  But that doesn't mean that it wasn't good.  It was very rich and creamy, maybe a touch too heavy on the nutmeg in the sauce.  The other two mains were complex and incredible.  To me, each of the desserts were too rich and I could only eat a bite or two, but I was so full that even if I had loved the desserts, I probably would've only eaten a bite or two.\n\nAll in all, it was a great night and a lot of fun and I'll definitely be back to the Dandelion soon.",1,7He2tF83YGi8cgbPXByEUg

The service and seating arrangements were terrible.  We were squeezed into a makeshift table in a corner next to a fireplace upstairs.  You knew it really wasn't a table because even the manager came and apologized for squeezing us in such a tight space (if you knew it was an uncomfortable spot, why use it?  I would have rather NOT gotten a table).  The temperature control was awful.  There was a draft (actually, literally wind) blowing into the corner the whole time, and the server explained this was the ""cold"" corner of the restaurant because the cooling system was directed at our corner and had to blast for a while to cool down the entire floor (again, if you already knew this was the air circulation spot, why was a table placed there???).  I was wearing my coat by the end of the meal because it hadn't gotten better.  Finally, the straw that broke the camel's back was the server's decision to take orders from a table of 7-8 people rather than quickly getting their already disgruntled customers out (ones who promptly placed the credit card down within his view as soon as the check came).  He chose to ignore our credit card and take orders from the large table (probably expecting a big tip), and after waiting for over 10 minutes, we had to walk the card over to the register.  Unacceptable.\n\nWhile some might argue they deserve points for apologizing and explaining, my issue is they KNEW we were stuck in a terrible location - both space and temperature wise - and they STILL seat people there?!  Are they really going to lose that much money from that tiny corner spot that would be perfect for coats?  The food was fine.

On Saturday night we originally had reservations at Butcher and Singer, but decided we didn't have the time or energy to get dressed up for a fancy dinner.  Luckily, we found a 7 pm reservation at the Dandelion, where we could have great food in our jeans.\n\nThe Dandelion looks so cute and kitchy inside, I loved it from the very beginning.  Our waitress was sweet and fun and happy to make recommendations.  Yes- this is a loud restaurant, but still quiet enough to carry on a conversation without any trouble.\n\nThey have a very large bar menu, including lots of great beers (and cask ales, which we had never tried before).  My husband got a flight of cask ale and then a pint of the one he loved best.  I stuck with my beloved Young's Double Chocolate Stout, which they have ON TAP!  If you like beer, you will find something that suits your tastebuds.\n\nThe menu is kind of eclectic gastropub fare.  It's full of old favorites, but has enough variety to make it interesting.  My husband opted for the deviled eggs appetizer, which he loved.  The eggs had just the right amount of curry, which made them delicious.  I couldn't resist the cheese plate, which was huge (especially for one person), but exactly up my ally.  Every cheese on the plate was incredible- a soft and subtle cheddar with cheddar crackers and grape chutney, a brie with grapes and these wonderful nutty wafers, and a blue cheese with biscuits and honey.  I loved that as much thought was put into the accompaniments as there was into the cheese selections.  For entrees, my husband went with the burger, which he proclaimed one of the best he's ever had, and I had fish and chips.  Now I love fish and chips and this did not disappoint- moist flaky fish with a wonderful beer batter.  Fries were basic, but hot and good.  I was too stuffed for dessert, but my husband got a lemon mousse cake, which he really enjoyed.\n\nThe night was a little pricy, but really not bad considering I ordered a giant cheese platter for myself and we drank beers along with dinner.\n\nYes, I will return- yes, I will bring people there to make them try it too.

The hostess informed us our table wasn't ready so we sat at the bar and ordered a flight of wine - which was AMAZING.  Due to a private party in the back of the restaurant, we were seated a few minutes late which wasn't a problem since we were entertained with wine at the bar.  Once we sat down, what appeared to be the owner, quickly brought us a complementary plate of lightly fried calamari, their appetizer special of the night, and apologized for the wait we endured while we had a reservation.  I was very impressed!! About 2 minutes later, the owner then proceeded to bring us 2 complementary glasses of REALLY NICE champagne!! He commented that he knew it was our anniversary and he wanted us to celebrate!! Hands down he best service I have seen in Philly and not to mention the food was AMAZING.

You can tell this is a bar frequented by locals the second you walk in. There's a nice outdoor seating area right on the sidewalk (perfect for people watching) and if it wasn't so chilly we probably would have sat outside to enjoy ourselves. Me and a friend decided to sit at the bar even though it wasn't super packed on a Saturday afternoon. The bartender Eddie gave us immediate service and was super friendly. He even let me try a few brews so that I could pick the one they fit my taste. I ordered the brunch burger based on Eddies recommendation and he was spot on. It was filling but not greasy and tasted like it was fresh off the grill. This place is a gem and you should certainly check it out if your in the neighborhood.

We ordered 5 items and none of them had a wow factor. \n\nFor starters, we ordered the deviled eggs and salmon & trout Kedgeree cakes. So, the deviled eggs are basic and overly salty. The Kedgeree cakes were good but they tasted more like a kielbasa sausage flavor and not even a hint of fish. So they confused me, I wondered if they changed it up on me and expected me not to notice. \n\nMy sister ordered the watercress salad with salmon instead of chicken. They did a great job on the salmon. You really can't mess up a pile of plain watercress on a plate. So... \n\nI ordered the ""Rabbit Pie"". Umm. Ok hold on a second. When someone says Pie, what goes through your mind? Ok now cancel that thought because this isn't a Pie! It's a soup with a pastry like biscuit placed on top of it. It has a soup consistency and not pie crust whatsoever. A pie would've been thicker at the very least. \n\nSo again, I'm confused as to what I just received. Clearly either British cuisine is lost in translation or the chef decided to have jokes. \n\nThe cappuccino was nice and we also ordered the sticky toffee pudding with banana ice cream. That pudding(cake) was fantastic and paired very well with the banana ice cream. \n\nAs a courtesy they brought out a dessert board for us and almost everything on it was great. The only thing I could say is that it's my taste for certain items that I didn't care for but tried to see how well it compared to others I've had in the past. \n\nSo when I asked if some things were lost in translation I found out that pudding is cake and custard is pudding. That's fair. But then when I asked about the rabbit pie, it was compared to shepherds pie. Yet even though there's no crust in shepherds pie, there's the mashed potatoes on top, which when mixed gives it that pie consistency. So that leaves this pie still more like a soup and croissant rather than a pie.",2,82Micw6atbqgn8-r7oNRKg

The food isn't anything to write home about but their drinks are on point. You don't go for the food anyway. The people could not be friendlier and the service is amazing. Furthermore, they will teach you how to play any game you want and will recommend games to you based off what you already like. The staff here are so knowledgable and I'd rate this place 6 stars if I could. I can't wait to come back!",0,buiqKEnMkc4_-Uai5BA06Q

I recently went to Bar Hygge and was first taken aback by the cool decor and vibe - a great addition to Philly and the neighborhood.  It's a warm & inviting space and I really liked how the bar area, the 'lounge' area w/sofas and the restaurant section were all connected, but still a bit separated.  In my opinion, it's a great layout, so you can visit and sit based on your mood and intent of your visit!  I was greeted by a warm & friendly hostess & snagged a window seat.  The menu was very good, we stuck with the boards - food and dessert - and our waiter did a really great job guiding us through it and answering questions.  The new veggie tortilla was incredible, as were the cheeses & interesting accompaniments...refreshing not to see the standard marcona almonds & honey (I love both) b/c I really enjoyed the balsamic strawberries and the homemade bread & crostini were both out of this world. Enjoyed the brussels and avocado puree and the cheesesteak buns were so yummy, too!  Dessert of choice for us: tastykakes - they were delicious & hit the spot.  Wish I had more room for other entrees and desserts - next time I will come with an emptier stomach.  The wine selection was really fantastic and the beers were, too!  \n\nI love the space's openness to families but it's still great for dates or groups - bar hygge seems to be a place where you can make your visit what you want & need, which I think is wonderful and aligns w/their identity.  After looking it up, I learned 'hygge' is the art of building community & paying attention to what makes us feel open & alive.  Bar Hygge offers the ability to be intimate, to be social or to be part of the community through their food menu, drink menu & seating options, which I appreciated.  I can't wait to go back & customize my experience based on what I am feeling & open to that night.",1,cKZGBYr3zDZXZ0gtwQIAGA

I'm putting in my 5-star review here  and hopefully I'll be able to help spread the good word. :)\n\nI went to the Dandelion today and really enjoyed it- The place is beautifully and thoughtfully done- reminds me a lot of Freeman's in Nolita (check it out if you're ever in NY, ah, how we miss it-)  The food was delicious (we got the Sunday beef roast, fish n chips, and the crab/cod/curry cakes in case you were wondering!) and the service was great! They had a pretty awesome drink selection including beers and cocktails. We only had beers tonight but we'd love to come back for the mixed drinks and/or happy hour. \n\nNo problem, no hassle, no complaint about our meal at all, nada. Having just moved to philly from nyc a month ago, we're really happy to have found the Dandelion. The place is definitely at least a solid 4 stars according to our every-day-we-go-out-to-eat-foodie-enthusiast standard. We will be coming back.\n\nAlso, I got kind of curious about what some fellow yelpers may not have enjoyed about this restaurant that prompted them to give it a poor review... I would like to just add a little side note about what I noticed.. come on guys (or ladies), if you said in your review that all in all you liked your meal, enjoyed the service, and/or did not have any problem with the place, why not be generous and give it a nice review? You probably see which reviews I'm talking about... 2 or 3 stars is a bit too harsh for an all-in-all good and enjoyable experience at a restaurant, don't ya think?\n\nGive the Dandelion a try!

Their apps are tasty and run around $7-10 for things like fish croquettes and deviled eggs.

I would have given three stars, however this week we ordered a calzone for takeout that came back very burnt. When I called, their solution was to bring it back for another. The only reason I accepted this is because I live across the street. We decided we just wanted to bring it back for a refund and the man behind the counter looks at it and says ""This is burnt? Wow, then go to Gusto's"". Not admitting it was burnt and telling us to go to Gusto's as if it were a place for people who don't know anything about food is a really lame, elitist attitude for a mediocre pizza place.\n\nUPDATE: I attached a screenshot of a message I received from the owner after leaving this review.

We got the kale Caesar salad and the Welsh rarebit as appetizers--both very good. We got cheesy cauliflower and sweet potato as side dishes--also very tasty!  Prices were reasonable, especially considering the unique characteristics of the menu. The rabbit pie was filling; I definitely did not leave being hungry.

The interior lives up to the name for sure - the cozy couches and warm lighting and low key decorations definitely gave off strong ""hygge"" vibes.  We got a few beers they had on tap and I got the rose sangria they have on tap.  It was so refreshing and perfect for the summer - also dangerously sippable, that thing was loaded with liquor and definitely didn't taste like it.  \n\nI ordered the kale polenta (because I am a total sucker for a good poelnta) and my friend got the clam strip po boy.  I snacked on a few of the stray clam strips from the po boy and it was delicious, well fried and super flavorful.  As for the polenta, not so much - the polenta itself was alright, although the walnut petso was to die for.  The honey chili glaze was also pretty delicious but without those accoutrements, the actual dish was alright.  \n\nShoutout to the fries though - those fries were real thick, crispy, and fluffy.  They didn't mess around.  My friend said also that the sauce on the po boy was amazing and he wished that was the dipping sauce for the fries instead of just the regular ketchup.  Service was overall great, nothing to complain about there.\n\nThere's outdoor seating as well, but the inside is so comfy I would recommend that instead.  I think Bar Hygge is definitely a place I'd recommend to people who aren't adventurous eaters - this is for a plainer palate (which isn't a bad thing necessarily) with some solid draft and cocktail selections.

I favor the burrito because of their delicious home made hot sauce.

Any time I go to philly, The Dandelion will be a must. There was so much detail and thought put into every item on then menu. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated and has a historical atmosphere. The only reason I didnt give it 4 stars is because I went for afternoon tea, and felt that we were very much in the way and a burden when they are trying to switch over to the dinner shift. Our waitress seemed annoyed and disappeared for long periods of time. I had to track someone down through the restuarant which is several floors and rooms, so I could get a check. We were even moved to a different room because the one our hostess was trying to sit us was going to be used. The tea sandwiches and pasteries were the best ive ever had, but i think id go for lunch or dinner instead.

The atmosphere alone would have me coming back here again and again but it's the food and the service that close the deal. \n\nWe had the scones to start and and they were outstanding. The one little( and I mean really minor) downside was that you have to pay extra for the clotted cream which, being a British fare eatery, would just be a given. But the scones came out warm, moist and so delicious!! \n\nI then had the Bangers&Mash which were out of this world delicious. The sausage was perfect as were the potatoes and the onion gravy was loaded with flavor. And it was the right portion for a brunch time meal. Not too big and not too small. My friend had the Shepherds Pie which she said was delicious. \n\nFor desert we had the Sticky Toffee Pudding. All I can say is Oh. Em. Gee.

Twice in one week I experienced this.\n\n1. Reservation for 9 people. They only had us down for 8, and squeezed in an extra chair so some of us were a little squished. It wasn't awful, and I would have let it go except for my second experience.\n\n2. Reservation for 6 people. We waited about 20 minutes for our table. They had us set up for a table for 4 in the upstairs bar area: two chairs and a bench, with an extra chair on one end. The bench was clearly meant to hold two people. If three people were all skinny and all best friends, then OK the bench could hold three. I flat out told the hostess that this wasn't going to be comfortable, and she tried to explain that the table reserved for us was still occupied and then finally stuttered and got us an extra table. \n\n2a. Once seated, we waited 15 minutes for anyone to greet us, and almost 30 more minutes for the food.\n\nI feel like most restaurants in this neighborhood can handle the lunch rush and should be able to, since most people at lunch have at most an hour.\n\nThe food is not bad. The deviled eggs are a favorite. The turkey club is a satisfying lunch with a side of homemade potato chips (ok, crisps, since this is British). The fish part of the fish and chips is fresh, flaky, and the batter is not too heavy. The menu is a crowd pleaser with nothing too exotic. \n\nDandelion would be a fine place for a lunch with coworkers if based on food alone.

The decor is part of the charm here -  most of the rooms are adorned with man's best friend, but it's the different motifs that catch your eye. Be prepared to move from a pub to a British tea room. \n\nThe servers here will start you off with still or sparkling water, which is complimentary no less!\n\nPimm's Cup [$10]\nPimm's #1, fresh cucumber, orange, lemon, strawberry\n\nThis tipple is sweet, light, and refreshing. Dangerous drinking - if dangerous means you want to knock back about 6 of these. \n\nDark & Stormy [$10]\nGosling's dark rum, ginger, lime, ginger ale \n\nI went with another traditional drink - the ginger provided great brightness on the finish, with the subtly sweet undertones of the dark rum and the tartness of the lime providing the backbone. Nice. \n\nIron Lady [$12]\nOld Overholt rye, Thatcher's apple ginger, Agnostura bitters, orange peel, Luxardo cherry\n\nI also went with the rye-based nod to Thatcher. The smooth essence of a Manhattan was brightened by the apple ginger liquer. And once you've had Luxardo, you'll never go back to the bright red standard Maraschino's again.\n\nBread Service\n\nBut on the food! The bread service was varied and delicious. In addition to some house-made sourdough, a honey stout bread embodied with the essence of Victory Storm King stole the show for me. Served with a pat of room temp butter (yes!) and Maldon sea salt, the slightly bitter and somewhat sweet notes prevented me from saving adequate room for all the food that was to come.\n\nWelsh Rarebit [$4.25]\n\nWhole grain mustard, cheddar, buttermilk toast\n\nWe started off with Welsh rarebit - essentially British toast with cheese spread. The mustard came through nicely amidst the melted cheddar. The sharpness really made each bite. The buttermilk toast was well-crisped on the crust, with the inside maintaining a fluffy texture.  \n\nHouse-made Ricotta [$10.25]\nExtra virgin olive oil, dried herbs, toasted sourdough \n\nAnytime there's house-made ricotta, it's a must-order for me. This was creamy, yet light with the lemon and herbs providing some freshness. Carbo-loading was the definition of this night, with additional sourdough being offered here. \n\nCrab Risotto [$15]\nZucchini, charred leeks, lemon gremolata, saffron, chilies \n\nThe server knew we were eyeing the crab risotto as well and compliments of the Chef, we received this dish. The creamy, succulent crab risotto is made with fresh crab stock. The grains maintained an al dente bite and the lemon gremolata provided some brightness. But the real star here? Surprisingly not the jumbo lump crab, but the Fresno chilies which provided a nice kick on the tip of the tongue.\n\nBeer-Battered Fish & Chips [$19.75]\nLine-caught cod, tartar sauce, triple cooked chips\n\nThe GF and our friend went with this old fern-bar standby. If you're looking for a well-executed fish and chips in Philly, look no further than The Dandelion. A huge filet of cod is encapsulated by a crispy batter that was surprisingly light. The triple cooked chips had some crisp on the outside and a substantial creaminess within. You can't go wrong with this order. \n\nHouse Blend Aged Beef Burger [$16.50]\nVermont sharp cheddar, Brooklyn brine pickles, apple smoked bacon, Churchill sauce \n\nWhen I heard that The Dandelion's burger won Philly Magazine's Best Gastropub Burger last year, I knew I had to give it a go. The bun was the perfect vessel for a perfectly cooked medium-rare burger, with the aged essence providing the desired beefy funk. The juicy beef was locked in with a well-seasoned crust and the bacon provided additional heft to each bite. The artisanal pickles thankfully weren't overly brined and provided some crunch to offer some texture. When you come to The Dandelion for happy hour, don't just come for the drinks. Do get the burger. \n\nMacaroni & Cheese [$12]\nBraised ham hock, Quickes English cheddar\n\nYou didn't think we stopped there, did you? If mac and cheese is on the menu, it's a safe bet I'm going to check it out. The cloth-bound, aged cheddar provided some oomph to each creamy bite, with the ham hocks adding richness. I can also attest to the fact that this was just as good the next day.\n\nSticky Toffee Pudding [$8]\nVanilla ice cream\n\nAnd of course, since we were celebrating the GF's birthday, we had to get something sweet. This traditional dessert was gluttonous and rich in every way. The caramel tuile provided some texture and the vanilla bean ice cream was a sweet, cooling element to the dish. \n\nSo if you're looking for a great date night or simply a fun-filled night with great drinks and food, head to Rittenhouse and through the doors of The Dandelion. The dishes and cocktails are well-executed and if it's possible, the service is even better.",2,kO30XR2WeF6bla6dK1ZZLw

I called Day by Day, as well as the others on the list the library provided, and set up a lunch meeting. \n\nAs soon as I arrived at the restaurant, and met Stephen, I felt comfortable. The food was well-prepared, but not fussy. One of the chefs grew the herbs in his yard. The tomatoes were fresh from Jersey, at least when that was in season. Stephen promised that he would be there with us throughout the wedding day. And, he was enthusiastic about preparing some Persian food that is not part of their standard menu. (My husband's family is from Iran, so we wanted a mix of American and Persian food.) \n\nThe process of working with Day by Day was so pleasant - I got to try lots of food from their regular menu while planning my wedding. We even chose Day by Day as the spot to introduce our two sets of parents to each other.  (The benedict and stuffed French toast are great, but my real favorite is the tuna melt, which is perfection.) Stephen and Robin even went on a recon mission to a local Persian restaurant to try one of the dishes we had asked them to prepare. When we decided to go with a custard dessert instead of wedding cake, Stephen and Robin were there to find a way to make it work. \n\nThe day of the wedding, Stephen was there whenever we needed him, even for all of the things we hadn't anticipated. (An Altoid mint before the ceremony? Absolutely. A glass of water during the photo session? Exactly what we needed.) At the reception, everyone raved about the food. Even the Iranians agreed that their take on the Persian dishes was fantastic. \n\nThe restaurant can be crowded - we went in the morning after our wedding with a party of six, and had a little bit of a wait (maybe 20 minutes), but it's worth it.

It's a way to save some money, check out the food, service and general ambiance then make a decision for future dining (or not) based on those 3 factors. \n\nI persuaded my chronically over worked friend Frank to knock off early on a Friday and join me for Forsythia's happy hour. We arrived at 4:27 p.m. and found their door unlocked and the servers just putting the finishing touches on things. We chose our seats at the spacious bar and took a look at the offerings for the 4:30 to 6:30 happy hour. Note-if you want to order off the regular dinner menu, you have to wait until 5 p.m.\n\nThe first person to serve us was a bartender with lilac colored hair. She was not at all friendly and acted like she was doing us a favor by deigning to take our drink orders. There is a nightly, bartender's choice cocktail for $10. I can't remember what this night's was called but we were told it was 'like a Stinger.' A traditional Stinger is creme de menthe and brandy or cognac and what we got was NOTHING remotely resembling this but it was tasty enough. In my experience, happy hour special cocktails are never very good and this thing was no exception.\n\nWe sipped our drinks and filled each other in on our week and while chatting, another bartender (male) joined in our conversation after first apologizing for 'interrupting.' Frank and I both laughed and reminded this gentleman (who we learned is named Tomas) that in Philly, if you are at a bar, in reality you are not just talking to your companion, you are talking to everyone at the bar. Tomas gave us some background about Forsythia, Chris Kearse, a spot I had just tried on Snyder, how he got the job at Forsythia, who he had worked with in the past and a run down on the happy hour menu. His expansive, welcoming demeanor and easy chatting style more than made up for the dour, lavender tressed woman who served us earlier. He made me feel like we were in for an enjoyable trial run of this place, which had not been my first impression. \n\nWe ordered truffle & ham hock beignets, panisse with raclette cheese, beer battered cornichons and at Tomas's recommendation, the crispy pig tails. \n\nWe were served gratis ciabatta bread with house made buttercream infused with maple. The butter was just barely sweet and we wiped the plate clean to be sure we got every bit of it. I would have loved warmed bread but then I'd love being independently wealthy, too. \n\nThe canapes (as the menu calls them) were all unusual and extremely delicious; the only exception being the cornichons. They were not bad but the batter was not very crisp and they just tasted like limply breaded pickles. Pass on these. Tomas described the crispy pig tails as really good sweet and sour pork and that is what they were. Caveat-if you don't like finger food with bones that you need to pick up and nibble and gnaw, give these a pass. Otherwise, consider them a fun, toothsome and out of the ordinary appetizer. As it was now after 5 p.m., we also ordered the whole roasted hen of the woods mushroom with smoked ricotta, madeira and sumac. It was succulent and savory and I could have inhaled another one by myself. \n\nWe were checked on and chatted up often enough to feel welcome but at no time was our bartender's conversation or attention invasive or unwelcome. Frank had another round of the happy hour cocktail and I opted for a Manhattan. Tomas asked me about liquor choices. I told him I trusted his judgement as a mixologist and suggested he take free reign with my drink. Shortly after, he served me the most subtle, smooth Manhattan I have ever had the pleasure of sipping in all my years of imbibing. When he asked, ""how did I do?,"" I laughed and complimented him, adding that the road to Hell is paved with Manhattans just like the stellar one he'd mixed. \n\nBy now the bar seats were all taken and Frank felt like he needed to get back to work, so we departed Forsythia and assured Tomas we'd be back again soon. \n\nMy only complaint, and this has nothing to do with food or service, is draftiness from the front door. The door to the restaurant opens directly from the street, there is no foyer, and cold air rushes in each time the door is opened and chills ones back. Now that lower temperatures are here for several months, I hope Forsythia sees a way around this.",10,UN6MXJuhyGcX7LTj4-b7FA

One word of advice I would give is to stick to the apps and small plates - those are out of this world - but the main courses and pasta are just meh. \nThe atmosphere is warm and cozy for a winter dinner, it felt really nice but not too stuffy.  The service was attentive and quick but not overbearing and our waiter really knew his way around the expansive wine list (a true feat given how long their list is!). \nSpeaking of the wine list... its huge, one of the best and longest I've seen in the city.  We all started out with one of the wine flights, though they're on the pricey side they do not skimp on the amount they give you at all.  We finished with some glasses and some bottles of wine we liked off of the flights and the best part is that we came away having tried and loved wines we hadn't tried before. \nWe shared a ton of apps and some pasta dishes.  The apps were all wonderful, tasty and well done! I'd specifically recommend the tuna carpaccio, the burrata, the octopus and the shrimp! All the starters were very good.  The pastas look amazing and we ordered 2 to share but neither lived up to our expectations and were kind of bland.  I'd say skip the pasta! We didn't try the main courses though they did sound really good! \nOverall a very nice experience, I truly think the best way to do it is to go for the wine and to share a lot of of the smaller plates!",4,n0iFO9S6ZvOBh15pLeMwMw

I searched Yelp but nothing really stood out except the Dandelion. I'm really happy we chose to eat here. We came here on a Tuesday evening and it was still packed, even the bar. The wait was 30 min so I ordered my first drink- the Pimm's cup. Now, I don't usually drink since I do not like the taste of alcohol, but this drink was actually pretty good- fruity but not too sweet, refreshing, carbonated. It felt like I was drinking soda but the drink still had a decent amount of alcohol since I got somewhat tipsy haha (but I am a lightweight). I would highly recommend this if you're into these kinds of cocktails.\n\nShortly after finishing my drink, we got seated. We started the dinner off with the Chicken and Duck Liver Parfait (since we read really good Yelp reviews about this dish) for $15. This was a very unique, interesting appetizer to try. It tasted kind of like sour cream and had a whip-cream consistency/texture. The brioche bread was warm, fluffy, yet slightly toasted-- it tasted great with the parfait. I would recommend it if you're looking for something more unique.\n\nFor my entree, I chose the Duck Bolognese ($19.50) which tasted like spaghetti and ground beef. The texture of the noodles were different (it was strozzapreti, not spaghetti) and I thought the dish might have tasted a little interesting with the duck, but I was a little disappointed that it just tasted like ground beef. It was still good though.\n\nOh I forgot to mention, I got another drink- Basil Strawberry cocktail. This one was definitely stronger - you can taste the vodka and it initially tasted a little bit like medicine, but after a while I got used to it. I enjoyed the Pimm's cup better though.\n\nFor dessert, we shared the eton mess sundae which came with coconut sorbet, fresh berries, and tarragon meringues. Omg this was one of the highlights of the meal and so refreshing even after such a filling dinner. I would highly recommend this if you're looking for a lighter, frutier dessert.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my experience at the Dandelion and would be back if I'm ever back in Philadelphia. The ambience of the restaurant is dim, laid back, pub-like but still classy, romantic. I don't know how to explain it but it had a great vibe. The service was also outstanding... we had like 3 or 4 different waiters constantly checking up on us to see how we were doing. 5/5 stars for sure!",0,nmAq3Nfaw25rOm4KKrw7JQ

In colder weather, the vibe in the neighborhood is grittier.  There's limited signage at the front of The Dandelion (just a large antique looking wooden door), a sharp contrast to some of the down-market, in-your-face type establishments in the area.\n\nDownstairs was full at 9pm on a Friday but we found a couple of seats at the upstairs bar.  Lots of ironic pictures of dogs playing poker, Staffordshire statues, etc.  I don't ordinarily order bottled beer at bars but tried the Prairie Bomb (13% ABV). Great coffee flavor and with a bit of a kick given the ABV.

Delicious Fries, Fish was moist and the ratio of beer battered crust to fish was just right, and the tarter sauce was nice. I understand the general complaints about the value of the dish. It's $22 for something that costs about 12 quid in the U.K., even with a price increase because of the Rittenhouse location, this is at most a $17 dish.

Delicious, crusty and chewy with a nice touch of salt on the crusts.  Every plate that we oogled as it went by was beautiful.  Staff friendly and funny.

So so so delicious! It was the perfect bowl of comfort food - reminding me of a delicious chicken noodle soup like taste. Will make my way back for this.\n- Gnocchi: Homemade ricotta gnocchi, mixed wild mushrooms, truffle cream. Absolutely delicious as well! Truffle/mushroom lovers dream come true. However I wish the gnocchi were a little bit smaller as they didn't absorb enough flavor.\n- Spaghetti Scoglio: Mussels, clams, shrimp, calamari, light red sauce.

Out of the two, I think I liked Cafe Lift just a little bit more. My friends and I came here late Sunday morning. I believe we waited about 30 minutes or so to be seated. We decided to share family style just so we could try a little of everything. \n\nHUEVOS RANCHEROS - Toasted corn tortilla topped with refried beans, pork chorizo, roasted peppers, cheese, two fried eggs, and a roasted tomato salsa. SO AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS. One of the BEST I've ever had. Definitely better than the one at Sabrina's. I'm used to soft corn tortillas as a breakfast dish; however, at Cafe Lift, their tortilla is toasted and crunchy. It was flavorful and spicy, just the way I like it. Very filling.\n\nLEMON RICOTTA PANCAKES - Although we got it as a side, the lemon ricotta pancakes were delicious as well! It was light, moist, and fluffy. The lemon flavor was just perfect. :) \n\nCANNOLI FRENCH TOAST - Challah bread dredged in a cinnamon vanilla custard with bananas, chocolate, pistachios, and ricotta cannoli filling. Portion was HUGE. I was not a fan of this dish just because it was a bit too sweet for me. This dish would be perfect for those with a sweet tooth and love cannolis.\n\nWhen I first saw the menu prices, I was a bit surprised to see breakfast dishes less than $11 especially when portion sizes were HUGE. I would overall give this place 4.5 stars (rounded up to 5 stars) for their prices, portions, and flavorful dishes. If I lived in Philly, I would frequently visit Cafe Lift and order my favorite dish, Huevos Rancheros. :)",0,Ml2i2mGdUyrRswXZZlbKNw

All were excellent! The pasta was super fresh, and while the creamy sauce for the ravioli was memorable, the tomato sauce was pretty outstanding too! We literally licked the bowl clean!! So good! \n\nThey have fresh salads to start, including a prosciutto melon and a caprese, and desserts like the classic tiramisu we really enjoyed also. So crazy to think of what they offer ""fast"" here! \n\nDaMo served as the perfect ending to a family night over at Tinsel right across the way. It was easy, no reservations were needed at the last minute kind of place, and the food was awesome, even though it was served in such a casual, pay at the counter, order at a kiosk manor! \n\nPortions are perfect. Not too large, not too small, Goldilocks style and prices were appropriate. \nPellegrino to accompany, and we were a happy bunch! \n\nI know the kiddos will beg for this next time we're in the city looking for a quick bite to eat, and I won't feel bad about wasting calories on this kind of ""fast food"" afterwards.

The best things that I had there were the free chips and salsa, and the extra side of hot salsa we asked for from the waitress. I had the pork belly tacos and the flavor was seriously lacking. I love pork belly, and the meat although tender was not flavorful; it needed some salt and more oomph/seasoning. The cucumber and carrot slaw that was on top of it was very delicious; it was more enjoyable than the pork belly, but I got the taco for the pork and not necessarily the slaw. \nAlso, I understand this place is more of a fusion Mexican restaurant, but they have some tacos that are advertised as traditional tacos, and the waitress had virtually no knowledge of what comes in traditional tacos. She seemed to be confused when my bf asked her if the tacos were made in the traditional style, ie: onions, cilantro, and limes, and he had to explain what he meant. I think it's important that the servers have more of an understanding of the cuisine they are serving. \nThe food is majorly overpriced for what it is. The 3 tacos were puny and came with no sides.

As I was expecting out of town guests, I planned the event more than three months ago--complete with several in-person follow-ups with the manager, Kareem, and the asst. manager (name unknown). One of the agreed-upon stipulations that we decided on was that I would have access to my table at 11:30 am to place my decor on the table and my parties' gift bags and special favors. I arrived today at 11 am to drop off my materials and noticed a party at my reserved table. I was reassured that the party would be out by 11:30, per our discussion. The party did not leave until 11:55-my guests had already arrived, my table was not decorated and my pre-planned event went horribly wrong. As a manager, you had two options-- find me another table at 11:30 to avoid the problem OR inform the party (that had paid their bill) that you gave an incoming party and that they need to leave. The asst. manager did neither. \n\nThe way my special day was handled was completely inappropriate and unprofessional.

I especially appreciated that the sauce for the beef rendang was not overly creamy, as it is at more mainstream Indonesian-Malaysian restaurants. The D'jakarta noodles (thin) were delicious as well - we originally thought it came in a meatball soup, but it turned out the meatball soup was served on the side. The table's favorite dish was the fried chicken in sweet sour sauce - the exterior was lightly crunchy, the meat was incredibly tender, and the sauce had that mouthwatering savory-sour balance of flavors.\n\nWe also ordered a few drinks - the mango one was basically dessert in a cup and worth ordering, but the other drinks (e.g. Milo and teh kotak) are generally served in cartons/cans with an up-charge - if you've never tried them before, they're worth trying out, but if not, you can find them at any Southeast Asian grocery in Philly.\n\nA few large shared plates came out to ~$30 for three (with plenty of leftovers to spare), which is a pretty solid lunch deal in my book.

Almost two months ago the owner was at the 30th street post office waiting to pick up a package.  I knew him, the line was long and he wasn't mailing anything so I told him to go in front of me. He didn't want to, afraid of offending the other customers. In a somewhat unexpected occurrence, everyone let him go to the front. I mentioned to the six or seven customers he had the best pizza in town, and to my surprise he offered everyone a free pizza.

I have been trying to find THE BEST PIZZA EVER for 25 years.  I have been all over Boston, NYC, SF, FL, you name it.  I even went to Osteria down the street, which was ranked the #1 pizzza in the US by a Food Network guy.  Just OK.  But NOTHING compares to the perfection that can be found at Cafe Lift.  It is the perfect pizza.  Perfect size (for one hungry dude), perfect texture (crispy, thin crust), perfect sauce (an incredibly mild and delicious tomato sauce combined with -literally- ""the secret sauce"" sauce---PESTO).  And the cheese is the buffalo type.  Not too much cheese, not too little.  The result is EXACTLY what I have been looking for during the last 25 painful years.  I now come here for lunch EVERY time I'm in Philly and don't even bother looking at the specials or the rest of the menu.

Me, I got the crab and scallop quiche with 2 sides, mixed green salad and rosemary potatoes. Took about 15 minutes for our order to be ready for devour-ment (clearly not a real word).\n\nWell, the waiter (who was not our waiter) brought the pancakes to the table as well as the side mixed green salad. As I was about to eat the salad he brings over the quiche with a small salad plated with it. So, I said ""Wow, the waiter didn't tell me there was a salad with the quiche or I wouldn't have order this one. In an unwarranted manner, way toooooooo much attitude and snarky, he said , ""Well did you ask him if a salad came with it?"" I looked at him in disbelief and my tongue was very close to a lashing of the tall brunette with a beard and mustache but I had to realize who was the server and who was the paying, vocal customer... No match... \n\nSince I was once a waitress, I always gave respect and always ensured if service is good I tip wait staff well because I know about the wages they make. Although ruffled, I realized this guy was not even my waiter. Once our waiter returned I advised him what happened. He was apologetic and stated he forgot to tell me it came with a salad since it was not written anywhere. I respected him telling me he forgot.  No harm, No foul. I tipped him well and left without complaining any higher.\n\nBut I have an memory like an elephant and if I ever return here and the bearded wonder is my waiter, he will not get one cent from me no matter how well his serve is. You get one chance to be rude to me,I don't do sloppy seconds.\n\nThe food overall was just okay on this visit. Quiche was somewhat dry with an overdone crust. Rosemary potatoes were slightly overcooked but edible. Maybe another visit may yield better results.

Though the seating was in nice view of the televisions by the bar, I still felt cramped for even though there were not many people around us. Perhaps it was due to an increased number of tables for restaurant week, but there was something to be desired in terms of space.\n\nAlthough we originally intended to select options from the restaurant week menu, my friend and I instead chose the executive lunch menu which was ten dollars more but offered a much better value (primarily the filet mignon). When the food finally came, the caesar salad was ok, but nothing spectacular. I have a feeling the croutons were the same ones from the bread we were served a few moments earlier just hardened. The filet mignon was cooked to the right temperature, but definitely not the best steak I've had in Philly. The dessert was surprisingly better than the filet mignon and the strawberry cheesecake was better than recent cheesecakes from memory.\n\nOverall, the best part of the dining experience was the interior decor and I feel that most of the prices on the menu reflect this to some extent. \n\nPros: amazing interior design, friendly service, great place for a romantic date\nCons: overpriced for the hype, definitely not the best steakhouse in Philly",2,N83n3TZu94MVrgv4Tp9tNQ

Even one of the simple, two eggs and homefries is taken to another level here.  There are plenty of places that phone this one in, but not Grubhouse.  It's done right.\n\nAnother time, I opted for the special of grits with hot sauce, cheddar and fried chicken skin.  This was just another world of good.

A sweet pie runs about $5 a slice, while a personal sized savory pie ranges from $8-9.  And because Magpie keeps its menu focused and simple, it means that these homemade pies are really, really, really good.\n\nI came here on a frigid January night with one of my besties for the Winter Warmer special: one savory pie, one sweet pie, and your choice of coffee or tea ($14).  We both got the Chicken Pot Pie: a small but dense concoction of tender chicken, buttery vegetables, warm gravy, and a flaky savory crust.  All of the ingredients worked really well together and the pie was perfectly sized.  I also enjoyed the breadcrumb and cranberry sauce topping, reminded me of a mini Thanksgiving dinner.  As for dessert, I opted for the Butterscotch Bourbon pie while my friend ordered the Chocolate Cinnamon Coffee Pecan.  Both were served with homemade whipped cream and tasted amazing.  My pie was soft, creamy, and sweet without being overpowering.  Hers had a warm chocolatey center with a soft flaky crust to balance it out.  You can really tell when you taste the pies that they're made with care and quality ingredients.\n\nMagpie also gets bonus points for the terrific, personal service and free wifi.  The servers could not have been nicer or more helpful, and really make you feel at home.  My only gripes?

When we arrived, we were amazed at the cavernous feel of the place, the high ceilings, the stone columns and the huge red-draped windows.  It is an absolutely amazing restaurant space,......that is, unless you want to attempt to carry on a conversation without having to shout to the person(s) you're dining with.  We were seated at a table & sat next to each other, and still had to repeat to one another almost every word uttered through the dining experience.   The tables are also very close so that you're also competing with the people seated next to you. Something needs to be done to muffle the sound, because you really can't talk without shouting.  It was also difficult to hear and communicate with our very efficient and eager-to-please waiter, Jake.    He did a really terrific job of describing menu items, specials and the like in a story-telling manner that actually kept me wanting Jake to tell me more!\n\nWe shared the shrimp cocktail appetizer with a trio of sauces recommended by Jake (the old standard red cocktail sauce was by far our favorite!) and their signature crabcake in a spicy lobster sauce which was one of the best crabcakes I have ever tasted.  The bread is also delish and they encourage you......no, they force you to break the break with your hands, which felt awkward in such a fine restaurant.   Jake recommended  and Hubby went for the bone-in filet and I did the lobster and we again shared so that we have the quissential ""surf and turf"" experience.  The lobster tail was a full 14 oz cold water lobster and it was sweet succulent, especially with drawn butter.  The filet was, hubby proclaimed, the best he ever had.  It was flavorful (yes, the bone does indeed impart that additional flavor to a cut that is sometimes flavorless) and you could actually cut it with your fork.  We shared sides of yummy garlicy green beans and these huge onion rings, which were just OK.  Dessert was their 6-layer lemon creme cake, which Jake made sound more delicious than it actually was.\n\nThey have a tremendous wine line and lots of very nice selections by the glass.  Jake made a nice recommendation of white wine for me, as I don't care for red.    The coffee is also wonderful, one of the best we've had in a restaurant in a long time.   While many of the hostesses in the restaurant wore skirts they clearly poured themselves into and could barely walk as a result (those 5"" heels don't work too well either!), they were nonetheless pleasant and accommodating.  They did, however, really pour on the appeal when a group of men would enter and be seated.  They swayed their way into the dining area to put on a show for their charges until seated.  Overhearing one of the conversations from a table full of said men, they actually thought they had a chance with these cute young women.  Oh well, I guess that's all part of the Del Frisco's show,  cause this ain't a cheap date by any stretch and if you were left paying these hefty prices for the food alone, well golly gosh you'd feel ripped off!  This is definitely just a special occasion place for us.....when we're not talking to one another!",0,v6nsU587W-PTTla8KcAcXg

The interior is a converted old bank, and it actually feels a bit surreal to eat either in the vault or the vast expansive 2nd level. The wine list is a novel. The cheese steak egg rolls are overloaded with cheese, but I think the calamari is the real award winner - a sweet glaze and accompanying slaw compliment an extra crispy exterior with a perfect, non-overcooked piece of squid in every bite. The portion is great. For those non-purists that can appreciate sauces with their steak, the triple filet special has some amazing sauces that had me licking the plate when my girlfriend and server weren't looking. The blue cheese crumble was mouthwatering. The seared tuna has been my go-to twice now- wish they had more sauce than what is in top. The mushroom side was a little salty but still very very good.

The window displayed all the crêpes that you could order, immediately I knew that I had the try this place.\n\nInside was super crowded since it was the grande opening. I was impressed how fast they took and completed the orders. It took about 5 mins in line to order and another 10 mins of waiting to get my crêpe. I decided to get the matcha chocolate truffle crêpe. It was $7, which I though was a fair price for the size of the crêpe. The price range for this price is pretty small, the cheapest is $6.50 and the most expensive is $8.95. They serve a wide variety of crêpes, ranging from sweets and desserts to chicken and steak. You can decide to add on more toppings for an extra price, I chose not too. They serve the crêpe in a paper cone with indented lines that you can follow to rip off making it easier and cleaner as you eat. \n\nI will be coming back to this place soon to try some of their other favors!

The fresh mozzarella in the dish was some of the best we've ever had! We couldn't decide what pizza to go with so we ordered two. First was the margarita, fresh tomatoes and mozzarella. Wow! The pizza was amazing! We also went with the wild mushroom pizza. While this pizza wasn't as good, it was more complex. The mushrooms were a big overcooked and rubbery. The truffle oil is a very strong oil. Overall it was a good pie but, not one I would order again. Normally we wouldn't do dessert with lunch but we couldn't resist. We went with the banana bread pudding with homemade ice cream and cherries. When it first came out we didn't think it would be good. It looked dry and boring.

We had out of town guests and this is a beautiful building we thought our friends would love. I had been here before and felt the service has slipped a little. We did arrive 20 minutes before our reservation and couldn't be seated. We were told to wait in the bar area, which was fine.There were several other parties in the same position and the servers/hostesses just seemed confused on which parties were where. Not a huge deal, but for a restaurant charging easily $50+ a plate, I expect a little more finesse. There is a Sunday special menu that we were not offered or told about when we were seated. Having been here on a Sunday, I knew it existed, the special is also listed on the website. I was not thrilled by the menu basically being hidden. And when we did ask about it, we were only brought 2 menus for our table of 4. On to the food - it was good. The Sunday deal is a salad, steak (choice of 2 cuts) with crab cake, and choice of side. We all chose the Sunday pairing, but added some extra sides and appetizers. Steaks were cooked exactly as we ordered and mostly seasoned very well (one person in our party felt it was a little over-seasoned, but still very good). Sides were a mix - mashed potatoes and lobster mac and cheese were standard steak house fare. Creamed spinach was pretty awful. Caesar salad (generally a steak house staple) was weak. For $59, the Sunday dinner is a good deal. The building is absolutely beautiful and is worth a visit for this or even just for pre- or post-dinner drinks if you are eating elsewhere. For normal night, when the same meal would cost double, it's way over priced and you should head to Butcher and Singer down the street. I certainly don't mind paying high-end prices, especially for a steak house, but at those as prices the food does need to be outstanding.

While the other times I've been, this was a pretty-well oiled machine...reservations were timely, food was as described, drinks were delicious...but this time, it was the perfect storm...reservations were a running an hour behind and the food wasn't prepared well.\n\nAs for the reservations, I get it, people take longer than expected, parties bring more/less than expected, etc.  But, all the staff had to do was just tell us 'hey, we are running 60 minutes behind, we are sorry, but wanted to manage your expectations.'  The bar's fine, there were seats, it wasn't crowded, so we could've just started our meal there instead of being antsy and agitated.\n\nAs for the food - the beer/cheese pretzels are awesome, kind of a sucker's bet (unless you have a party of 3+) since you know you'll be ordering a ton of other food here, but you can't not order these as an app with your beers.  The fried pig tails are a treat as well and were done nicely...I was pleasantly surprised by the sausage cheesesteak as well, the roll was awesome...so those are the positive highlights...\n\nThe big knock for me was the pork shoulder special...It comes out in a big pan with a side of pickled veggies (beats, cauliflower, carrots) which were tasty.  The pork looked amazing, dark crispy skin, but as the server presented it and started to say 'it will just fall apart, let me get it started for you guys' - she stuck the two forks into it and pulled and nothing happened...she kind of looked up and walked away.  Leaving us to try and carve away at the meat...it wasn't undercooked, but I think maybe it was just cooked too quickly.  We've had this before and it pulls apart with little to no effort, but we were struggling to separate meat from the shoulder on this one...very disappointed, esp since the server could have done something about it, but instead she just walked away like nothing was wrong.  I probably should have said something, but I know it takes a while to prep another and it just wasn't worth the battle...\n\nI hope this isn't a trend with Vetri's side endeavors...because this happened to me at Osteria...first time we went (within 6 months of opening) it was fantastic, just like alla spina...but as time goes on, it feels like they don't put as much care and love into the service and food.

My 16oz Prime Ribeye was cooked to a perfect medium rare. Since I was staying in a hotel that night with no options for leftovers, I hunkered down and polished that steak off. \n\nService this evening was top notch.

It's vast expanse is mesmerizing, and it becomes more vast with every delicious cocktail you quaff.  \n\nDel Frisco's also is the place to been seen; even on a random Wednesday night, the place was jammed with glitterati, politicos and movers and shakers.   One suspects the bar has become a magnet in the aftermath of the the Four Seasons Hotel's closure and the Ritz-Carlton's precipitous decline post-Chef Ripert. \n\nAt a recent outing, we cut a wide swath through the menu.   Everyone raved about the cheesesteak lollipops, the jumbo shrimp cocktail, the steak tartare, the wedge salad and the composed salad of beefsteak tomato and red onion.  As to the latter, the dressing was superb but the salad would be improved if the onions were soaked to reduce their pungency.\n\nThe table's entrees included various cuts of steak, the lamb chops and the veal.  The carnivore chorus sang their elation in perfect harmony.  Although not on the menu, I enjoyed a dinner portion of filler-free jumbo lump crab cakes.  The best crab cakes I have had outside of Annapolis.  \n\nStandouts among the sides were the garlic spinach and the lobster mac and cheese.   Our friends singled out for praise the potatoes au gratin (far too dense with cheese for me), the asparagus (with sliced almonds) and the mushrooms.   I surmise the onion rings were not a favorite inasmuch there was no positive commentary.  \n\nThe table's desserts received also rave reviews.   The misnamed ""chocolate soufflé"" was actually a lava cake accompanied by the most gorgeous vanilla ice cream with chocolate chunks.  The other crowd-pleaser was the butter cake.

Despite a timely arrival for a reservation that clearly wasnt necessary, we were still escorted to the bar. There, we waited 5 minutes, only to be shown to our table as soon as our drinks arrived. But I digress, thats how the game is played. \n\nOur waiter was prompt and well versed in both wine and beef, which defied his apparent youth. He accurately described the different cuts of beef and was confident and forthcoming in his disclosing which cuts were not dry aged. He also didnt try to sell us the most expensive cut on the menu, or force a ridiculously priced bottle of wine down our throats. In short, he was a consummate gentleman. \n\nWe wisely passed on starter plates and stuck to only 1 side so we could actually enjoy dessert on our most recent visit. I went with the bone-in ribeye, and wife got the filet. At the moment, this IS my favorite bone-in ribeye in Philly. Although not dry aged, it came well seasoned and sizzling on a hot plate of clarified butter - very similar to Ruth's Chris, but much more flavorful. Wife's filet, which was also very good, had nothing on that ribeye. Our steaks arrived relatively quickly, however, I dont like the kitchen staff telling me to cut into my steak the second they set it down, as I still prefer to let it rest a bit longer. Plus, for $49, I expect the guy at the broiler knows what the hell he's doing.\n\nWe settled on the chateau potatoes for our side, which were creamy and flavorful if not a bit spicy. We've had the onion rings in the past, however, they're just too big, and can be chewy. Plus, they look ridiculous stacked up at the table. Whatever you decide on, I find that the side dishes are stingey in size - I wouldnt recommend more than 2 people per side (except the onion rings). I also dont like that the wait staff insists on spooning the sides onto my plate - thats something I'll handle on my own, thank you. \n\nFor dessert, I wussed out and went with the molten chocolate cake a'la mode. Wife made an uncharacteristically bold move and ordered up the lemon layer cake. My dessert was nothing to brag about - too many other places already do the whole molten chocolate cake thing, and frankly, some do it better. But that lemon layer cake... that shit was CRA-!! Moist, lemony cake layered with decadent, lemon ganache and iced with even more lemony, buttercream frosting. They gave her a huge slice too, so I got to enjoy the leftovers for breakfast the next morning.\n\nOverall, this is a top contender for best steakhouse in Philly. Wife still prefers Smith and Wollensky, as she feels its more romantic ambiance and veiws of the park are superior to Del Frisco's brash, masculine, power-broker atmosphere and views of... nothing. However, its hard to find fault with the incredible building that the restaurant is in. Did I mention the lemon cake was unreal?",2,L0yksjKsJrvY6CBGGuX70Q

He gave us a generous discount on the meal for our 11 family members and also gave us cards to come back as his guest.

My one friend highly recommended T-Swirl, so after dinner in Chinatown I decided to give it a try. Before going in depth about my experience, I was highly disappointed. \n\nWhen I envision a crepe, I imagine a flaky, delicious, and warm dessert. Unfortunately this was not the case at T-Swirl. First off, it had taken near 20-25 minutes for my crepe to be finished. There was a fair number of customers, but nothing insanely overwhelming for the fully staffed cooking area. I really couldn't put my finger on what took so long. I know a good crepe takes time but 20-25 minutes seems a bit absurd in my opinion. The staff was friendly, but this was not enough compensation compared to the time it took to make the crepe and the quality. After my friend and I received our crepe at about $10, we were ready to tuck into the chocolate strawberry crepe topped with a scoop of green tea ice cream. Aesthetically it looked beautiful, but it was a sham! The crepe had cooled down to the point where it was basically room temperature. I wouldn't have minded the temperature of the crepe but following the other ingredients it was just not delectable. The pieces of chocolate were so cold that it was hard to chew and the chocolate flavor was incredibly overpowering. The only tasty parts of the crepe I enjoyed was the strawberries, which were very fresh, and the green tea ice cream. Although these pieces of the crepe were great, I did not come to T-Swirl for only ice cream and strawberries. Collectively it was a poorly constructed and less than satisfactory crepe, and with the addition of the wait it is safe to say I will not be returning here again. Overpriced, underwhelming, and time consuming.",1,tLw73XgIzfO1yuHWTC_wRA

I've been here for both happy hour and dinner. On one occasion, came here with about a group of 6 for a birthday dinner and after a few rounds of apps/meals/drinks, the chef sent out a few more dishes to our table on the house. Cool atmosphere. Lovely service.  I was impressed. I will be back for sure. \n\nOne caveat: I should add that I originally heard of Alla Spina because they were voted best Philly pretzel in Philly Mag 2012 (yup that's all it took) now while GOOD I personally couldn't say BEST (anyone tried the pretzel at Bru?!)... and nope not going to stop me from ordering them every time I come.",0,0m6KJhYz7sZEFUAVfYJDDQ

Bright graffiti art contributes to the cool, casual vibe, as do huge windows that face the street. The unique beer list leans towards pricey, hard-to-find Euro-imports but the house beers by Victory (relatively cheap at $5 a pop) are refreshing and tasty. For the non suds-inclined, Alla Spina's cocktail program has plenty of solid options like draft negronis.\n\nOur server kept glasses full, helped extensively with menu selections, and made us feel accommodated. All of the food we sampled tasted sublime. Worth noting is that the vegetarian options extend beyond the token veggie omelette, though nothing seemed discernibly vegan. I opted for the testina hash poutine and was rewarded with a gut bomb in the best possible way. Crispy (though somewhat oversalted) fries married happily with intensely porky pieces of pig head, rich hot sauce hollandaise, and crispy fried eggs. Definitely not for the faint of heart, but totally worth the extra miles on the treadmill I'll have to run. \n\nMy companion went with an airy valtellina frittata full of nutty spinach and fontina cheese. The crisp potatoes on top acted as a welcome textural contrast. We also split an order of Alla Spina's donut misto, and these fluffy fried delights boasted strong flavors (chocolate cake, pistachio cream, apple) balanced with the perfect amount of sweetness. \n\nEvery dish we had is worth ordering again, though I can't wait to return to sample Alla Spina's other enticing brunch plates. As my first foray into the world of Vetri, Alla Spina certainly delivered. Excelling in food, drink, atmosphere, and service, Alla Spina is my new favorite brunch in Philly. Oh, and did I mention there was no wait during peak hours?",2,Yft76ogF5YzCQ4mn6vSQ6Q

My husband and I decided to split an order of that and also get a pork roll egg and cheese.  At $7, the portion size of the french toast is perfect.  I thought it was a tad salty, but overall was really delicious.  The breakfast sandwich was $4.50 and was a decent size as well.  It was only a buck more than I usually pay for the crappy Dunkin Donuts breakfast sandwiches and it was much better quality.\n\nOverall, I really enjoyed my meal here.

This is why instead of one star I'm giving... .two \n\nMy s/o and I decided to go here one evening after not going for a while. During the summer we would go here a couple times a month, so much that we had to stop and take a breather so this was our first time back. We stopped in at 8pm in hopes of sitting downstairs since we had only experienced the 1st floor. They were booked until later which was cool because someone left right when we got there and we were able to grab a table against the wall. \n\nWere very hungry at this point and I'm drooling over the menu. My s/o had to tell me to CHILL and that we should start with 3-4 plates and order more after. I said I GUESS. The sushi we ordered came out first and we inhaled it. We then waited for our brussel sprouts and cod fried rice. I was excited to try the cod because I usually got the shrimp kimchi. 20-25 minutes had gone by and you know I love my man to pieces but we have been together for a couple years now and weren't there for the first date stimulating conversation vibes we were there to eat. Against our better judgement we called our waiter over and ordered more food and asked about the two plates that were missing. Mind you that the table next to us got the chefs tasting menu and while were sitting there staring at each other they were receiving plate after plate.  \n\n10 more minutes go by and guess what? A plate from our second order rolls through before we even received the plates from the first order we put in like 45 minutes prior. I hear our waiter say that the kitchen is slacking on bringing our plates out even though in the back of my mind I think they gave them to the table beside us. My s/o overheard one of the patrons from the table say ""I don't even like brussel sprouts!"" ...... !!! \n\nAt this point were over it and tell the waiter we don't want the fried rice or brussell sprouts. He gives us the Shannon Sharpe ""that aint no problem"" response which kind of leads me to believe they never remade it? A bus boy comes to the table after with the 2nd plate from our second order and says ""did you guys already receive this?"" and were like huh? No? We asked him to please tell our waiter we would like the check and he says okay. \n\nThe waiter had the audacity to come to the table after we cancelled two orders and asks us if we would like dessert or tea? UM? NO? Please just give us our check. He says sorry for messing up the order which doesn't seem sincere and brings it over and we dip.\n\nHaving worn many customer service hats in my time I feel like double knot could have been more on it. I'm sure there were a lot of patrons below us but at 8pm the 1st floor was dying down and emptying out so waiters were standing to the side. I just don't get how you can see our table empty for 20-25 minutes and just say oh well. Like I stated before I was eager to order more food after that. Just paying for only 3-4 plates of great food felt like I wasted my money when I was willing to order more and spend more if the customer service was on point. I could have went to chic fil a instead and been greeted with a smile and can do attitude.",4,1vcfc6fucrEDQ_IJV4DuYA

Standard menu, nothing unusual. They do have sushi, but they do not have a sushi chef and there's no way the sell enough volume to have fresh fish, so beware of that. I usually get good ol' general tso chicken or sesame beef. They use fresh veggies and decent portions.\n\nI have two major complaints about this place:\n\n1) Inconsistency - sometimes the food is made really well and it's some of the best Chinese takeout I've had... and then other days, I order the same dish and it's completely different and terrible.\n\n2) The servers are unfriendly and incompetent. Don't try to ask for a substitution or an extra side or anything, they either flat out refuse or they don't understand what you're talking about when you ask for extra rice. I asked for green tea one time and the girl didn't know what I was talking about, so I asked her what kinds of tea they had... still getting a puzzled look. She honestly thought there was only one kind of tea (Jasmine). And no, it is not a language issue, they all speak fluent English.\n\nAnyway, in summary, I still order from here when I'm in South Philly because when the food is good, it's very good, and when it's bad, it's still decent and probably better than anything else in the area.",2,v-AikaO3uxvyzfDOIkE5vg

Let me tell you, it was the perfect dinner celebration for such an occasion. \n\nFirst off, the restaurant is located in an old bank and has a huge main room with big marble columns. There is also a huge wine tower located at the center of the bar which looked cool. Overall, the entire layout was very impressive and I liked it alot. \n\nIf the scenery wasn't enough to wow you, then the food certainly will. Everything we ordered was excellent. My Dad and I had prime ribeyes (no bone), and his girlfriend had fried oysters, the del frisco salad, and some of the sides we ordered and my Dad's steak. For sides we ordered mushrooms, baked potato, and lobster mac and cheese. The ribeye was the best ribeye off the bone that I have ever had, and my Dad agreed whole-heartedly. It was juicy, tender, cooked just right, and was perfectly seasoned. It also had the right amount of marbling and was not too lean or too rich. My Dad's girlfriend loved her oysters and said they were the best she has ever had as well, and she also thought the steak was ""to die for."" The secret star of the show (#2 in line to the ribeye, of course) was the mushrooms. Who would have thought that mushrooms could taste so good? Not me. Del Frisco's cooks these mushrooms to perfection, I now can no longer look forward to when I make them myself. My Dad and his girlfriend savored every bite of the lobster mac and cheese, also proclaiming it to be one of the best they've had. \n\nThe service was top notch as well. Our water glasses were always refilled even if we barely drank anything from them, and our waitress constantly checked up on us. At the end of the meal, the manager, Timour (hope I'm spelling it right) took away some of our plates and asked us how it was. We replied that we were stuffed and loved every bite. He shortly returned with a giant slice of lemon icing cake, which was on-the-house. I couldn't manage another bite, but my Dad and his girlfriend said it was ridiculously good and took home what they couldn't finish. We talked to Timour for about ten minutes and after learning that I had just moved to Philly, he offered to buy me a beer if I ever stopped by again. Talk about quality service! Every restaurant should model itself off of how Del Frisco's treats its customers. \n\nI still have some of my ribeye left in my fridge and am looking forward with guilty pleasure to when I can have it again, which, if I decide not to cook, might be tonight! Yes this place is pricey but it is totally worth it; I will definitely be back here! That is, as long as my Dad picks up the tab again hah.",1,CqzxAgS3JHCTlbR5Aouzqw

""its been an hour and a half, give me the phone..."" so my ballsy friend calls, gets the skinny.  Johnny Chang's is taking 20% off our order and making us fresh sushi.  cool, right? so we thought.  so another half hour passes and the driver shows up, sheepishly, and hands us two soggy bags.  ginger dressing drips on my carpets, and it is SO obvious this sushi has been festering in its own juices for two hours.

Super rich, clear and you can taste that the broth has been brewed for a long time. Very flavor full, I didn't even need to add in any hoisin or sriracha or lime juice! Which I usually do!

Considering this is a ""meal"" I did not find it pricey especially for La Columbe coffee. If  I wanted to add bacon or tomato that would have upped the price a bit.  The staff was very friendly and asked me if I wanted to sample the ice cream.  I did try a small sample of the salted caramel which was quite tasty - - but I am not really an ice cream person so this was somewhat lost on me.  They seemed to have a lot of ""exotic"" flavors and the traditional vanilla and chocolate options were surprisingly absent. I think for the money this is a fine option to grab a bite to eat while you wait for a train, but given that grilled cheese is their speciality I would have expected it to be a bit tastier. The cheese used to make it tastes like a combination of kraft singles and velveeta. It is disappointing when you go to a restaurant and you feel like you can make their signature dish for better and cheaper yourself.With that said though, I will be back  but most likely only for the la columbe coffee.",0,Te3BwftEFN8C9WxImhfM_g

I made a reservation on Open Table and arrived a few minutes before our reservation. We checked in with the host after fighting our way past the 3 person deep line at the bar and were told we had to wait until a table leaves. We were waiting about 20 minutes and went to Sampan to get a drink since there was no way to reach the bar in the upstairs of Double Knot. The upstairs decor of Double Knot was unique but the narrow restaurant made it difficult to wait for the table to be ready without being crammed up against other people. \n\nWe were then taken down to the restaurant and walked down a long flight of stairs to a dungeon-looking dining area which my party and I thought was very cool and unlike any other restaurant experience in the city.There were melted candles lighting up the restaurant and metal barred walls. \n\nAs for the food, they served small plates like Sampan with an Asian Fusion Flare. Our ordered a lot of items off the menu and at the end were full, but not over-stuffed. We started with the tuna from the cold menu which was delicious and a decent sized portion. Next we had the Salmon sashimi which was one small piece of salmon per person. The flavor was just okay. The tempura cheese curds were to die for, I wish they gave more than one per person. The edamame dumplings are always a hit (I get them every time I go to Sampan- they are the same). They have a creamy filling & flavorful warm broth. For the ""entree"" I had the Broiled Seabass and our table shared the brussel sprouts and Black Cod Fried Rice. The sea bass was delicious but luke warm in temperature. It was also a VERY small portion. My friend ordered the Pork Chop which was triple the size of the seabass. The sides of brussel sprouts and fried rice were delicious and enough to share- no complaints. \n\nAs for desserts, we ordered all 4 because the server said they were ""bitesize"" and she did not exaggerate. It was nice to get to try all 4 options, but I think it would be nice if they made the desserts a little more shareable. \n\nOverall, I'd definitely go back to Double Knot for the ambiance & flavors.",1,VkVk8vlWVuTfD18cYWrAmw

It had an overly strong taste of old bay seasoning.. not good at all it was disappointing that it literally was puréed soup. Next was entree, we all got filets with mashed potatoes.

I looked around and table next to me asked me if mine were spicy too! Table across from me I saw the woman push hers aside and say I can't eat this. I'm not sure if the cook was accidentally seasoning food with pepper thinking it was something else but it was not enjoyable to eat.. we also got 2 sides to share, lobster Mac and cheese which was good, not a lot of lobster in it.

The last couple of times we went, they had soft shell crabs; we got the large ones for the same price as a restaurant would pay for them.  In about 6 months of buying our fish and seafood there (and we eat a lot of that!), we have only been unhappy twice (once when the cut was sloppily done, and once when we just didn't like what we tried) -- and when we next went there and reported to them that we were unhappy, they more than compensated us for it.  Not only fresh seafood, but we get our canned tuna, olive oil (incredible truffled olive oil!), kewpie mayonnaise, canned crabmeat, etc, from them at excellent prices.  And whenever they have Jadori eggs on sale, we jump at the opportunity to buy the best free-range, organic, orange-yolk (so orange it's nearly red) eggs we've ever had, at the same or lower price as we pay for free-range eggs anywhere else.

The crab was fresh and sweet, and the accompanying sauce was amazing.  \n\nSince she had struck gold in the appetizer round, I also consulted the waitress when it came to dessert, and the bread pudding she recommended was another winner.  (How would I have room for dessert after an appetizer and a big steak?  Well, see below for notes on the steak and why I might have left a bit on the plate).\n\nNow the not-so-good:  the steaks we had at our table were OK, but not great, and were certainly a step down from what you'd get at other places.  I ordered the rib eye, medium rare, and it came out cooked as ordered, but the meat was noticeably coarser than rib eyes I've had at other places.  Maybe it wasn't prime-grade?  I don't know.  Also, while the steaks were seasoned well enough, they didn't have the same seared crust that you get at a really great steakhouse.  My friends ordered filet mignon or the medallions of beef, and they had the same reaction:  OK, but not great.  \n\nOur server was good and clearly knew the menu well, and the apps and desserts were great, but with the main draw - the steaks - being only OK, this place gets 3 stars.",1,1QyLAyQxOqu-KNCtw-oXWw

We ordered a bun bo hue and a grilled pork/spring roll and shrimp vermicelli and the total came out to under $20. Def a tad cheaper than NY pho! We had to wait about 10 mins for our order so we walked around for snacks before coming back to pick it up. \nThe orders felt heavy- they give a LOT of food. The bun bo hue noodles/bean sprouts/beef came in a take out container that was packed to the rim (no picture because we couldnt wait to eat) and the vermicelli was also packed! First, the bun bo hue is a little different from how I am used to eating it in NY. not bad, just different. The vermicelli was also pretty good. The grilled pork was soo good, it was pretty much the star of the night for me. Not sure what it is but it was reallly tasty I wished I got just a grilled pork vermicelli.

The potato paled in comparison to the fam's favorite potato, rosemary in South Philly but that pie is kinda outrageous so I'm not sure if that's fair to compare. The Margherita while had it fresh basil, wasn't quite what I'm used to in a marg pie. It looked too much like a regular slice to me, but hubs thought it was very good. The pies all had a bit too much crust for my liking, but the fam didn't mind that as much as me. I think we would ask for it a bit more well done next time also? Personal preference. \n\n-They don't serve water! I mean, they sell bottles of water for $1 but do not offer tap and when I asked why, she said because they don't have a filter. I have never ever seen or heard of this and quite frankly, I'm not sure it's legal. We were given cups when asked, no ice. \n\n-No seasoning. I'm used to seeing parm cheese, oregano, and crushed red pepper on the table at a place that serves pizza. Here, it was a no go. I didn't bother to ask, but I didn't see any. \n\nYah: \n\n-What makes this place vey cool is the creative flavorful sauces you can choose to top wings or fries....\n\nHouse Made Hot Sauce (Buffalo Style Med)\nPeruvian (Mild) with Green Sauce (Med)\nItalian Lemon (Mild)\nKorean Style Hot Sauce (Hot)\nThai Curry (Mild)\nAdobo (Mild)\nChinese Salt & Pepper (Med)\nWe had no intention of ordering fries, but the sauce varieties sounded so tempting and were just as amazing as they sounded! DO NOT MISS THE SAUCES! We chose the Thai curry which had outstanding flavor with a coconut note! Yummy! We even dipped the crust of the pizza into the leftover sauce! Do this! \n\n-Our server was welcoming, knowledgeable and very kind. I believe our waitress was the wife of the man slinging our pies into the wood burning stove which is another plus! She informed us that the lies would be ""leopard spotted"" with black because if the ovens. I thought was a cute way of putting it. \n\n-I loved being able to watch the oven action right from our table. I also loved the TVs going with rotating family photos of what looks like a close knit Italian fam and what I believe was an episode of the chef featured on The Food Network! Very cool. \n\n- mini chocolate, chocolate chip cannoli were loved by my three. Very delicious they said! 3 for $2 I believe. Cheap. \n\nAll and all, we would give it another shot but try something different. We would definitely order fries again and try perhaps the Fontina, Pear & Sage pie hubs wanted as well as The Kale and Onion, Sea Salt & Olive Oil pie which I wanted to try. The fried pizza sounds crazy! Somebody try that! They also have a chocolate pizza....interesting!",19,3QnoTcrxuafMCoTzW_AH7A

Their service is prompt and professional albeit sometimes a bit busy. I think the best bang for the buck on the HH menu would be the 1) kimchi fried rice, 2) brussel sprouts, and 3) the rolls. All of the above are delicious and only a solid $4. I also really like the baos (comes with two per order) so I'd recommend that you tag that in on your order too. \n\nThe only downside to this place is that they don't take reservations for HH and it's not a very large space. Fortunately, every time I've come so far, the waits haven't been too long (probably 10 min or so), but it is a gamble. Also, the rules are that you seat yourself; when we arrived, we did kind of stand nearby one of the tables and watched them like a hawk as they were receiving their checks in case someone else snagged their table before us. So consider yourself warned if others start hovering near you when you're close to being done.

With thick slices of apples, caramel  and bits of granola plus a huge scoop of the most delicious vanilla ice cream made this treat unforgettable. Again, I could have eaten 2 of these.

One of her suggestions guided me here to Grubhouse. \n\nWe arrived right before noon on a weekday and found parking to be a bit of a challenge, but eventually found a space directly across the street. We were the only patrons and within a short time three other patrons walked in. Grubhouse has the look of an old timey type diner with a flick of modern and an inviting environment. Even before being seated, I already had my mind set on ordering the Baconcakes after being enticed by all the Yelp reviews. \n\nOur waitress was pleasant and took our orders swiftly. A short time after our breakfast beverages were served our orders arrived. My thin, crisped edge, moist pancakes were redundant in bacon; griddled in bacon fat, with large pieces of bacon infused within the pancakes and then bacon strips served atop the Baconcakes and then lightly dusted with powdered sugar...wow!! And there you have Baconcakes, a bacon lovers bacon overload...absolutely mmm, mmm, good!\n\nAside from the wonderful Baconcakes Grubhouse's menu has other interesting options. For instance, the bacon wrapped jalapeño tater tots, Salted Caramel French Toast or Pancakes, Breakfast Egg Rolls, Grubhouse Big Philly Omelete, and some vegan items to name a few. I really wanted to take advantage and order the bacon wrapped tater tots which were free with the Yelp check-in, but that would've had me on the verge of bacon gluttony, so I forcefully refrained. \n\nI considered this my off the beaten path find as its not in the touristy downtown area of Philly. If in Philly and you have the time, I suggest you check out Grubhouse as its menu has a bit of a creative flare not similar to your regular diner fare. An additional bonus in taken this short excursion to this side of Philly is that there's a cheesesteak spot directly across the street, a perfect combination win. \n\nI have to end this review by saying, thank you Sari M. for your guidance!",25,1k2ilG84PtPAm9cP_EQHjQ

BUT, what is funny is that all the 1 star reviews are very lengthy stories.   Mine is the same lengthy and with the same ""manager"" Alice.\n\n\nMy parents came in first with our kids.  My husband and I walked in shortly.   Alice told us that my parents are not up to their dress code.  We were shocked. Mom was wearing cashmere ""jogger"" and host insisted they were sweatpants.  I told her it is my mom's birthday and can't she let it slide?  Nope.  Our car was valeted already.  Hubby took my parents home to change.  Me with two young children cannot be partially seated.  It was difficult.  \n\nThis Alice came over a few times, trying to be nice.   She told us we can wait in the high top area, but cannot be seated.  20 minutes later, she said she can ""partially"" seat us in the basement.  I said no.  The kids are not vaccinated and we made a reservation and the first floor had ample empty tables.  But No, cannot be seated.  Later hubby and parents returned and were told we only can get seated downstairs, because I was not nice to her. \n\n\nGrow up, please.  You sent a 60 year old birthday lady home to change because of your snobby dress code.  The definition of ""business casual"" is quite arbitrary. Sneakers, hoodies are allowed but cashmere joggers are not?   Or hoodies depending on who wears it,according to other reviews here?  You would not seat a mom with two young kids.  And when I told you - I don't want to talk to you.   You get offended?!   \n\n\n\nIt is New Year Eve.  So they figured they were in power and they wouldn't seat us,at all,not downstairs either.

While the location is way more convenient for me, the service, cleanliness, and food just fell short. We were seated in the upstairs part of the restaurant which is pretty disgusting compared to the downstairs. There are large bins full of dirty dishes just laying around everywhere. Not a good first impression. \n\nWe looked over the menu but ended up with our typical meals: shrimp summer rolls to start and 2 bowls of steak pho. The service was not great- it was difficult to find our server to get tea and water. Also, we got the rolls at the same time as the huge bowls of pho, which was kind of annoying. The rolls were pretty good but nothing special. I started eating my HUGE bowl of pho (we got extra large thinking it was similar to the sizing at pho ha and they were way too big). The flavor was good.. and then I saw a bug floating around in my soup. Womp womp. We sent it back after we tracked down our server and I was given a new one very quickly, but the little appeal that the place had pretty much dwindled after this.

I  would have preferred to see a more creative menu that showcased the chef's culinary skills. The filet mignon steaks were cooked to perfection and everyone enjoyed theirs.   The salad and dressing was very tasty.  The chateau potatoes were served with our steaks and was very good, but I would have preferred some sort of signature chef's sauce and a few stalks of color/veggies ie  string beans, broccoli or asparagus. This would have made the meal looked more complete on the plate, rather than just steak and potatoes.  The cheesecake and choc mousse for dessert was delicious. Overall, it was a solid meal for $35 - however, the presentation and lack of garnish- veggies didn't appeal to my visual palate.  We also ordered sides of the lobster mac and cheese, spinach and gnocchi.  All were very delish.  We also purchased a bottle of wine, but we didn't enjoy the taste.

Japanese fried chicken- 8/10\n2. cheese curds. GET THE CHEESE CURDS. 10/10\n3. Japanese scallop sashimi- 9/10\n4. pastrami bao bun - 10/10. get this. especially if choosing between this and the duck. our friends got the duck and were not impressed at all. it might have been their least favorite of the night actually. \n5. swordfish meatballs - 6.5/10. these were good and fairly flavorful but maybe a little dry. I can imagine getting swordfish to stay moist in a meatball is difficult. \n6. short rib-15/10. hands down, the BEST item of the night. everyone in my party tried it and loved it and said it was the best. definitely get this. \n7. crispy Brussels sprouts- 10/10. if you've ever had the ones at sampan, these are the next best thing. I'm obsessed with them. \n8. fried rice- 7/10. my boyfriend loved this, as did our friends but I felt it was only ok. maybe I'm weird. \n9. spicy tuna roll - 5/10. honestly, not the best. if I come back I wouldn't waste my time or appetite on sushi.\n10. blue crab roll- 7/10. again, their sushi is not what I would come here for. go to fat salmon for sushi. \n\nour friends got the prawns and lamb and raved about both but I didn't try them so I can't say from experience... \n\noverall: great experience, especially if you enjoy small tapas style plates. it can be a little overwhelming to order and a little difficult to share in a larger group so keep this in mind. probably best for a date night with sig other or friend.",1,THJo4sOXgM4jxA9UUocJag

So I don't know if Fogo's salad bigger or higher quality or whatever. What I ate over there at Chima was good)\n\nNext was the main menu. The meats. Don't judge me.

I found it odd that they do not have salt and pepper on their tables.  I know that most white table cloth type of places do that.

I'd put my proverbial ear to the ground (aka read about it in The Insider / Foobooz) and my excitement would grow as signs of it's opening neared. Each day I would walk by on my way to work and glance in, and it seemed to be getting closer and closer but not opening, finally I couldn't take it and I shot them an email saying what's the deal, stop this nonsense and open already!! They told me to chill and it would be about a week. \n\nFast forward a few weeks and the day finally came for boo and I to spend our epic Sunday cheat meal at BF. We walked in and the place was jumping. NFL combine coverage on all the TVs, I felt like I could potentially be spending a fair amount of NFL Sundays here. There was not much of a line and boo and I each ordered the Brisket Burger bc why wouldn't you. 2 patties of ground brisket with Swiss and blue cheese? C'mon son. Then because I'm fat I got an order of parm fries and a Chicago style hot dog. Boo got a side of onion rings. Total cost plus a soda almost $40.00 a little on the high side for casual but whatev, if it lives up to its billing I'd gladly pay it every freakin' Sunday.\n\nAfter paying you shuffle down the line and wait for your buzzer to go off to get your food. I stood patiently in the corner while boo secured a seat. at the 15 minute mark the guy next to me became agitated and I was thinking it's only going to get worse from here. At 20 mins he went up and asked about it and the manager checked on it and told him it was up next. This whole time I would look back at boo and she would shoot me these dart looks like ""say something! say something!"" I would look at her like ""I ain't got the energy girl"". Our food came at the 30 minute mark. Famished I handed in my buzzer and took the food to the table. \n\nAs crazy as this sounds both our burgers were really bland. Thinking back I can't remember if they put the blue cheese on or not bc its illegal for blue cheese to be bland. We ended up drowning them in ketchup. Very disappointing. The sides we got we fine but the star here is the burgers and it just wasn't up to snuff. Feeling dejected we walked out with our heads low. A week later I was walking by around 7:00 there were about 10 people in there so I decided I ain't going out like that, this place has to be good and we just came on the wrong day. I got the standard Burger Fi burger green style. It still took about 15 minutes to get. The lettuce wrap was awesome however the burger didn't taste like anything. Another ketchup drowning and I left again dejected. \n\nI still am holding out hope that these are the early restaurant blues but I cherish my Sunday cheat meals and I can't take the gamble on Burger Fi again. Maybe a Tuesday lunch but not my Sunday.",3,sFqImuZBqT43URa3kMcC4w

It doesn't come across as a restaurant because of the Catahoula sign with the dog logo on it and maybe that's why it's so special- it's def. a neighborhood gem and this little Southern Belle was more than pleased to discover the New Orleans menu, which btw, since we arrived at 3, we could choose anything from the brunch or dinner menu- an extra bonus! We've since been here several different times and have tried a majority of the menu.\n\nHushpuppies (the best- spicy and larger than usual). Ghouda Grits (um, ghouda in my grits- yes, please!). Bacon-braised Collard Greens (they don't make them w/out bacon down south!). The hubby gets a ""my burger"" all the time and loves it.  \n\nWe were there for Valentine's Day because 1) they don't change the menu to some lame V-day menu and 2) they don't take reservations. We started with the hushpuppies (delicious again!) and fried green tomatoes (cut a little too thick, but tasty and spicy with the green onion aioli) I got the blackened snapper, truffled mushroom grits, ragout of crab, leeks, fennel & creole tomatoes and the hubby got the duck jambalaya (he loved it). \n\nOur favorite thing to do here is to order the peel-n-eat shrimp in creole spices/oil and a side of the ghouda grits. Peel some shrimp, put that on the grits, and then dip a forkful in to the oil. You will be praising little baby Jesus that you read this and tried it. I've never had their version of the shrimp and grits because this is honestly all I can think of. In fact, you can make a meal out of that alone between two people and be pretty satisfied!\n\nGreat beer list, too, (I love Abita brews!) and the service is always nice and casual (in a good way).\n\nSpecial note: There are about 7 tables in the restaurant, so I would choose a not-so-busy time if you don't want to wait.

They focus on Italian and change up their menu seasonally.  Most of the dishes are quite rich, and some can run towards the salty side, but this is not the type of restaurant that you would visit every week.  I think the most ringing endorsement I can provide is that I have enjoyed every single bite of food that I have ever put in my mouth here.  Items that stand out as my favorites include the lobster and shrimp pyramid pasta, and any of their scallops.  While the food is not cheap, it is not crazy expensive.  In fact, their four-course menu (your choice of any items from the appetizer, pasta, main and desserts) is one of the best deals in town.\n\nIt is true that it can be difficult to get a table at this popular and crowded favorite.  They only take reservations for pre-theater dining, so it is best to come here with an open mind and a back-up plan.  I have had decent luck on Sundays - especially if I show up before 7.  The atmosphere is casual and gets loud, and you will be seated pretty close to your neighbors.  This gets a little better during the warmer months when you can sit outside.  You want to sit outside during the warmer months since the open kitchen really heats things up indoors.\n\nI keep bringing out of town guests to Mercato, and they keep wanting to go back on every subsequent visit to Philly.  Keep in mind that it's cash only.  If you do the four-course menu, plan on a leisurely meal and make sure to bring plenty of wine.

I assume the regular (non-restaurant week) portion is much bigger bc it was $12 on the menu for a bowl as big as a tea cup. Nonetheless, the flavor was excellent, creamy but not overwhelming. My sister in law upgraded to the lobster bisque and was not every impressed, as it only brought 2 small chunks of lobster.\n\nAs for my entree, I had the steak salad with arugula, fresh mozzarella and roasted peppers. I really enjoyed the salad portion, the dressing was soft enough to enjoy the salad. I wasn't a fan of the steak though, very bland, I had to add both salt and pepper. I know that a good cut of steak doesn't need much, but AT LEAST some salt and pepper. \n\nDessert was really the highlight of the meal, which was the flourless expresso and chocolate cake.

She was communicative and responsive which I appreciated. The food was great and I loved that we could play to our hearts desire without having to pick up any of the ping pongs (there are guys retrieving strays). \n\nThe only negative was that we did not receive a cocktail/wine/beer drink menu, when we arrived, which I thought was weird. I like having a visual and not thinking on the spot for a cocktail I want the bartender to make. The other thing was our server was never around so it was hard to order drinks when our group wanted. At one point, I asked someone to find our server. \n\nInattentiveness was also the issue during our second visit with friends. We sat at the bar and it IMPOSSIBLE to get the guy's attention for a drink both for initial drinks and additional rounds.

I want an excellent gin martini, briny oysters on the half shell, a wedge salad with decadent blue cheese dressing, a mouth-watering Filet Mignon, ice cream for dessert, and a double espresso to top it off.  Oh, and all served by a knowledgeable, personable waiter in a wood-paneled dining room.  Well, CG could have hit this one out of the park - except for two crucial glitches.  The wedge salad was sub-par.  Iceberg lettuce is a waste, unless it is surrounded by the best blue cheese dressing.  Alas, theirs was not.  It wasn't the best - it wasn't even close.  The dressing was watery and had no chunks of cheese. I was very disappointed about that, and also about the French green bean with heirloom tomatoes side dish.  The beans were soft and not at all what we expected - they should have been crisp and flavorful, not soft and bland.  The beans seemed as if they had been frozen or just over cooked and the heirloom tomatoes were not to be seen - just one soggy grape tomato in the mix -- but the rest of the meal and service were superb.  We were seated immediately upon arrival.  Our waiter, Danny L., was perfect.  We selected Philadelphia's finest gin, Bluecoat, and Danny swirled the drinks at our table.  Nicely done Danny! The Blue points were great.  The 10 oz. Filet melted in your mouth, as did the 14 oz. Dry Aged Strip steak,  1/2 of which we brought home for another day!

I was pleasantly surprised at how relaxed, and quiet the place was. I felt almost like I had walked into a closely guarded secret or something because other than a few people at the bar, most of the seating was pretty open. The group of guys who I came with got an entire section to ourselves and each individual took up entire couches and got comfortable. The food is disappointing for the most part; the wings are boring and then some; the fries are not bad, and for the price you pay, it's a decent amount; the Mahi Mahi was so dull and the bun was chewy and not fun to eat. But I didn't care because it was a very relaxed atmosphere.\n\nThen came the second time that I went to this establishment, and it happened to be on a Friday. The two separate visits were like night and day. The obnoxious music being played by the incredibly amateur DJ was blasted at such a ridiculous volume that I swear I heard the hair cells in my inner ear screaming as they shriveled up and died an agonizing death. And then even more died when the aforementioned DJ (DJ being too good a term for this moron) decided that he was going to try... whatever he was trying (scratching I think), but it was so badly done that people actually stopped dancing. It was like a tone deaf old man with no sense of rhythm had gotten a hold of the music. The people in the bar seemed to be slightly older on average (than me), although there also seems to be a decent amount of guys who are in the college student age range (like me). And before I forget, the amount of people on the weekends makes the experience all the more aggravating. \n\nThe waitresses are quick, and seem to be very attentive to your needs, although not necessarily cheery while they're taking care of you. But most of them are attractive, so... you're welcome.\n\nGo when the place is quiet and relaxed, and it's an enjoyable experience. Go when the annoying music is playing, and the whole experience takes a nosedive. Unless you're into that scene I guess. Also, go down the street to I-HOP when you get hungry.",5,itI6CqeR92ikei1n86N5sg

At this time I informed the waitor I drink pretty fast simply because he took so long.  I figure I order it now and get my drink 15 minutes from now.  He was like I understand I'm Scottish I'll go ahead and put the drink in (his words not mine). So 15 minutes go by and I have an empty cup;  I literally see him walk by and stop make eye contact with my cup acknowledging it was empty.  So I'm thinking to my self.  Ok, he had to have seen it; don't say anything (I didn't want to be that impatient guy, you know). Sure enough 5 minutes later he walks by me again and I'm like "" hey bud, can I get that beer.""   He than try to feed me some line that "" he put the order in but it takes a while for the bar to get it ready"". This is a BOTTLED BEER where the bar is literally 20 ft from me.  So i watch him go to the bar; ask the bartender for the hieniken. the bartenders pulls it right out and pops the cap.  He than than has the beer to my table in less than two minutes.  Now I'm feeling a little uncomfortable; because I can tell he just forgot. Whatever though; I'm thinking maybe he'll use this opportunity to step up his game recognizing the fact that he totally forgot and he needs to tighten up a bit.   At this point my girlfriend and her mother both order their next drink.  I also asked the waitor if he could close the window.  He informs us sure he can.  10 minutes later he brings out my girl friends mom 's drink. Doesn't bring out my girl friends drink.  Ten minutes go by; the window is still open so I asked the hostess if she could close the window she does it immediately.  I finish my next drink at this point decide to go to the bathroom and start to think;  where the hell are our appetizers.  I look my watch and realize it's 7:50 and our appetizers aren't here.  So I call the hostess over because again I don't see the waitor.  I tell her we ordered appetizers at 715.  And it is 750 and our food isn't even here.  I also tell her he is taking way too long with the drinks and he didn't even bring out my girlfriends drink.  So she ask us what we wanted to drink and in two mins both drinks were right there.  Than the waitor comes and says will the tamatoes were frozen so that's why The appetizers were taking so long.  It was obvious he forgot to put them in.  So I informed him to forget about it and bring us our entrees because I didn't want those to be sitting in the kitchen getting cold while they started on our appetizers. Ten minutes later he brings us our entrees.  So now it's 8:00 and 8:05 and we are eating our entrees.  However we felt a little irate that we didn't get our appetizers and the drinks took so long. On top of that; we have a waiter insulting our intelligence by just Lieing to us.   So when the waitor asked us how everything was, I pretty much told him, ""the food was good but your service was horrible."" I know everyone has a bad day but dont lie to me; if you made a mistake own up to it.  He than apologized for Lieing and they gave us 19 off a 118 bill.

For what you get, though, $50 a person for the Rodizio dinner isn't that bad considering the quality of the service and the huge selection of meat.\n\nBest piece of advice: your meal is what YOU make it, so if you aren't impressed with the lamb (I wasn't), stop asking for it and have them bring you something else. The dinner is run by a card system.  Flash the green card if you want hunky Brazilian men to cater to your every whim and drop a stack of meat on your plate. Flash the red if you're too overwhelmed and need time and room on your plate to cut and actually try your meat.  \n\nThis explains why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.  It gets a little overwhelming after a while and god forbid you accidentally leave it on the green side. A server, carrying a skewer of ribs, will eye you from across the restaurant and make a beeline for your table. Just politely say 'no'.  What's great is that you can tell them ""send the other guy over that had the salmon"" and they'll grant your wish. \n\nCome here on an empty stomach and try everything at least once. I remember there was about 14 things to try ranging from filet mignon, leg of lamb, swordfish, etc.  I'd have to say that the best meat was the top sirloin...extremely succulent.  The waiter (who was very friendly and attentive) also brought us delicious fried polenta and bananas and some kind of gooey bread for sides.  If I came here again, though, I wouldn't waste my time on the salad bar or the sides.  It fills you up too fast. You get your money's worth during the meat sampling, so if you're a carnivore, go all out, check off your favorite meats, and order seconds and thirds. Remember, it's unlimited.\n\nThough we could barely move after the meal, we still ordered dessert.  I was going to order some apple pie dessert but the waiter insisted that we try the chocolate mousse cake. I'm so glad he did. It was a light, creamy chocolate mousse with a crunchy bottom and was served with a drop of raspberry sorbet and drizzled in dark chocolate sauce and a few strawberries.

I'm not a huge fan of Raw but I didn't want to let the voucher go to waste. \n\nI made reservations and confirmed that we'd be having the Ruelala deal.  This time, my issue does not lie with the quality of the food. It lies with the quantity of  food, atmosphere and service.  To start, we were served a very small piece of salmon. Next up was a bite of crab wrapped in whitefish.  Then striped bass carpaccio (tiny).  Then a decently sized portion of risotto/steak/one scallop/one shrimp.  Our 1 scallop was dry and rubbery but the rest of the food was good.  Then we got a small bowl of green tea ice cream at the end. The food came with 3 shot glasses of sake. \n\nNOW....about the service and timing of the food...AWFUL.  Right after we were seated, the 1st course came out.  We didn't even have our drinks yet.  Then the sake came out, but not the water we'd asked for.  Then the beer that we ordered arrived and still no water - had to ask again for water.  Then the 2nd, then the 3rd courses came out in rapid succession.  I figured at this rate, we'd be in & out pretty quickly.  WRONG.  We were stuck there for 2 hours.  I don't even know how much time elapsed between the 3rd & 4th course, but even averaged out, 5 courses in 120 minutes would be 24 minutes between each course.  Twenty-four minutes between each literal BITE of food.  I was so antsy that I wanted to leave without waiting around for the last 2 courses. \n\nAtmosphere: Dear Raw, could you remove a few tables please?? The tables are RIGHT NEXT to each other.  It's uncomfortable.  It's awkward. It's not romantic or intimate. The girl sitting next to me had her coat & bag all over my seat (probably because there was no room for it elsewhere), and upon being escorted to my seat I had to move it over (she wasn't paying attention).  \n\nI have no desire to return to Raw. If they want to be a high class sushi joint, they need to get their shit together.  Train your servers better.  School the kitchen on proper timing between courses.

I think its just another case of the man trying to keep us down.  Well not me.  Three and a half stars baby, thats my review and I'm sticking to it.  Take that Yelp/the man.  \n\nSo this place is kinda cool.  The building is laid out like a shotgun apartment.  Its narrow and sleek, stretching back from the foyer like an exaggerated hallway.  The sushi bar invites diners to check out the fish as they pass on to either the remainder of the dining room or the outside saki bar.  I like it.  I have to say, its stylish, yet not over-blown and while the decor represents the price tag, neither elicits an audible guffaw from would be diners.  \n\nSushi is a wonderful delight of tasty splendor, no denying it.  But, in my experience, there are the places that make a killer, well constructed roll and then those that take the rice-fish combo outside of the box by creating a symphony of gastronomic ingenuity (go to Sushi Zen NYC, you'll see what I mean).  Raw lands squarely in the former category and thats not a bad thing per se.  As such, the key is all in the ingredients.  The fish has got to be primo or its just going to let you down and Raw doesn't disappoint.   While the dining is sold, this joint's highlight is the outdoor saki lounge. \n\nHave a drink there during sips.  Then have another.  When you are well lubricated order some sushi and hang out for another round.  Just ignore the D.J. spinning the latest blogosphere house-bangers at 300 decibels.

I had not previously been there since the Zanzibar Blue days, never actually made it to the Speakeasy. Anyway, like Greg L., I found myself there because a friend of mine said it was a decent spot to watch the game. Our first choice was McGillan's, but as we expected it was overflowing by 6 pm. The Fox and the Hound has too many out-of-town fans for my liking, despite the close proximity to my home. Anyway, the positives to Tavern on Broad where their draft specials, which included a 5-8 pm half-off happy hour special, then from 8-12 was $2.50 domestics. Craft drafts for $2.50 for a few hours then switching over to the light stuff to finish out the night was nice. I believe their 5-8 happy hour is every weeknight, but the 8-12 special was probably related to the game, we didn't ask. The crowd was mixed and into the game, which was cool.  By the time the game started the place was packed.\n\nI looked at their website and it looks like they are trying be a nightclub on the weekends, at which point you will not find me there. Their TVs were serviceable for the game, but something was causing them to have a wavy distortion. During commercials they played pop music, which was fine. The acoustics were good when playing music, but not so much for the game. It was hard to hear much of the broadcast.\n\nWe also ordered some food which was just average. The bright spot was their hand-cut fries which were nice to munch on during the game. The bartenders were very friendly,  Marissa, I believe her name was, took very good care of us, almost too good by how quickly my beers were being replenished-then drained-it's the WS, my nerves were wrecked!\n\nI am tempted to give it a 4 for the cheap beers and great bartending, but due to the atmosphere being a little on the generic side, I am going to say 3.

Most were quite familiar, but I don't ever have to see chopped anchovies again.  They also served some sort of pasta tuna salad. That was downright weird and neither of us touched it.  We were happy with the kimchi, pickled cucumbers, tofu, bean sprout salad, Korean radishes... There were 9 served in all. A wonderful array of tastes.\n\nWe ordered vegetable tempura, pan fried vegetable mandu and pork bulgogi.  We don't normally eat that much fried food, I'm not sure why we ordered the tempura, but both were incredibly light on the palate. The tempura was average tempura. The mandu had a great crispy dumpling shell and the vegetables inside were spiced and diced nicely.\n\nThe pork bulgolgi was the highlight.  It was $20 for the entree, but served us both well (we had tons of food left over).  It wasn't the best I have ever had, but a completely solid dish.  The meat was sliced incredibly thin and marinated nicely.  The pork version of bulgogi is cooked in the kitchen as it is much more saucy then the beef bulgogi (there are bbq's installed in the middle of the tables so you can cook your own meat).\n\nWe had 3 different waiters and waitresses helping us, so that proved a bit difficult to get a check.

A good selection, tasty, and we asked for more and they gave it.\n\nAppetizer of the seafood pajun. Tasty, thick slices and plenty of seafood inside. A good choice as an appetizer (apparently you can get it as a meal, too).\n\nThe dinner itself - chicken bulgogi for one, I had the dolsat bibimbop (good use of vegetables, egg, and hot sauce in a very hot stone bowl), and the cod fish casserole wasn't bad (although spicy).\n\nAsk the waitstaff if you don't know much about the menu.

Here are 3 experiences that stand out the most, and explain why I'll never go back.\n\n-One of the times that I went for happy hour with a friend, we were barely acknowledged, and there were TWO bartenders! Thank goodness the drinks were half-priced because they were mediocre, and not worth the full-price. The empanadas are tasty, but on more than one occasion there were BONES in it! I almost choked on one. Imagine biting into a warm empanada and finding a bone, DISGUSTING.\n\n-Once again, I went back with a few friends on a Wednesday night, to check out their night scene. Music was awful, and the dance floor was empty. Place was DEAD. So my friends and I wanted to sit at a particular table near the front and order some food. When I look over, a MANAGER was sitting at the table DRINKING (and I know she's a manager because I've seen her barking orders at the staff). Very tacky and unprofessional. That just brought this place's level of class to the gutter.\n\n-A group of co-workers and I came for dinner. Our food took way too long to come out, which I don't understand because they weren't even that busy. And when it came, no one was really blown away. The only highlight was the lobster mac-n-cheese. The drinks were ok, but forgettable. And the kicker? Went to the bathroom right across from the kitchen, so you can see inside, and saw a huge roach-looking bug crawling around in there. That was the last straw for me. \n\nThere's nothing special about this place. Anything they have, you can get 10 times better somewhere else. Please don't waste your time or money.",0,y5AHTDLvs1GaZUo1WcSpbA

bjPUhanWoinHi2kywvVzBA,0,2015-01-26 15:25:29,0,lcMa2mBNeAzXa7gCcAj_Yw,3,"I came here on a Saturday night during restaurant week. Even though most places do not have restaurant week specials over the weekend, Mercato offered theirs: a $35 three course meal. If I was rating this place on the food alone, I probably would have given it four stars. But,  I have to start my review of Mercato with a complaint about their reservation policy. \n\nLONG WAIT DESPITE RESERVATION: I came to Mercato on Saturday night with my partner and parents for an 8:45PM reservation. We arrived on time (actually a few minutes early) but were not seated until 45 minutes later at 9:30. Skimming through other Yelp reviews, it seems like this is a typical experience for Mercato. I don't mind waiting for 10 minutes or so when I have a reservation, but this place clearly overbooks their restaurant and keeps  a lot of people waiting intentionally. And because the restaurant is small, you are forced to wait outside in the cold. We were definitely not the only people waiting a long time. \n\nFIRST COURSE: There were 5 or 6 options for the first course on the restaurant menu. I ordered the TRIO OF BRUSCHETTA, my partner and my dad got the stuffed meatballs and my mom got the arugula salad with pomegranate. Of the three dishes, I definitely got the worst one. The bruschetta was not tomato bruschetta like I was expecting. It came with a cheese bruschetta that just tasted like store bought cream cheese rubbed on toast, and some sort of chick pea bruschetta that just tasted like hummus. The meatballs and salad were much better dishes. The meatballs were a lot of food though so make sure you don't order these if you order a big second course. The salad was very fresh tasting. \n\nSECOND COURSE: I got the PORK CHEEK RAGU special and it was phenomenal. The pork cheek was nice and flavorful and the pasta was cooked perfectly. It was a perfect size portion and I think it was the best thing any of us ordered. My partner had the arctic char special which was good, but nothing special. \n\nTHIRD COURSE (DESSERT): I got the salted caramel panna cotta. The favor was great and the consistency was really desirable. If I wasn't so full from the meal, I may have enjoyed it more, but I really thought it was great either way. \n\nATMOSPHERE: This place is pretty small and nicely decorated. It would be good for both dates and for larger groups (there was a table of 8 behind us). You could all here each other talk. and BYO places work nice for big groups that are drinking. It was clean and modern looking. \n\nBOTTOM LINE:  The food here was very good but not exceptional. If you could come during restaurant week, it is definitely a good value for the money.However, the reservation policy here is pretty inexcusable and definitely made me take a star off of the rating.",1,iFqI2jR2N-KryNZ4dwxWog

Coffee- at $4 per cup for generic black coffee is incredibly high, no free refills for $4.  What amazed me the most is that the coffee was room temperature.  It is very strong so we asked for hot water on the side which we were given at no extra charge.\n\n2. Croissant -  I wanted to order some kind of egg sandwich...but they don't have that for breakfast!  I could order an omelet for $12 and then pay for additional bread, but the bread is not toasted.  The waitress said that since their bread is made every day...they don't toast it.  Uhm...does that make sense?  I ordered a $4 croissant which was good, but certainly not worth $4!\n\n3. Baguette- I wanted to give it 100% chance of success, so I noticed that the baguette was today's special...although I was there for breakfast, I figured this Belgium based restaurant would do an excellent job. I first thought of getting the ham and cheese baguette, but the waiter suggested I get the parmesan version.  So I agreed.  About 5 minutes later, she serves me a sandwich which for $8 has been the most incredibly waste of money.  It was a short piece of baguette with a slide of cold ham and cold cheese, amazingly even the bread was refrigerator cold.  I figure it took 10 seconds to put this masterpiece together.  No sauce, no olive oil, no salt or pepper, just literary 3 ingredients slapped together. It tasted just as it sounds.  It turns out, she brought me the wrong sandwich!  Then she corrected it and brought me the recommended  parmesan version...I figured, this one will be much better.  Amazingly it was 99.99% the same thing!

At first glance this place seems kinda douchey, especially on a Friday or Saturday night with dudes in suits at the bar and blue/fuchsia-lit white leather booths full of loud nicely-dressed drinking groups. But the food itself is worth a try. It's basically small plate comfort food, with a menu that goes heavy on frying, mayonnaise-based sauces, creams, breading, and oil.\n\nThe first time I went, we balanced the small plates with salads and those were excellent. The brussel sprouts were THE BEST I had ever tasted, a divine mix of earthy, sour, sweet, and salty. Unfortunately the second time I got them, they weren't executed so well and they came undersalted and extremely oily. Chicken empanadas are good, the veggie ones I would definitely pass on as the cheese is undetectable and the slimy texture of the mushrooms (seemed like shittake?)  was an unpleasant texture for the dish. \n\nCalamari is good, as are the spicy potatoes. Most of these dishes made liberal use of their spicy aioli which seemed to go with everything. We had some kind of salad with a basil ice cream which was amazing.\n\nAs some other reviewers have mentioned, the desserts are nothing to write home about. The mousse is particularly bad- texture was heavy and grainy and not at all in a good way. Also, they served it with whipped cream on top which very obviously came from a can, which for me was a huge turn-off in a restaurant of this price/caliber. \n\nAll in all, there are better tapas places in the city (JAMONERA!!) but this place has had free tables every time I've looked so it's a nice fall-back with decently interesting, albeit a little over-priced, food.",0,6DEkMOIT6ZeO7LNS-cI5NA

I ordered through DiningIn, which takes a long time, but is a very reliable delivery service...that is, it's reliable when the restaurant actually fulfills the order.  In this instance, I ordered, and an hour later, when the food was supposed to arrive, the DiningIn rep called me to profusely apologize for Catahoula's screw-up.  Apparently, DiningIn's driver went to pick up the food, and the restaurant informed them only then that they had absolutely no item that we had ordered (totaling 6 items from the menu).  Catahoula apparently did not bother to communicate this at all until the delivery driver went to get the food, nor did they bother trying to contact us to apologize, but rather left it to DiningIn to break the news.  \n\nIt's all well and good to have great food, but in a town where great food is readily available at hundreds of other places, you might want to be a wee bit more customer oriented.

Tomatoes in the mac and cheese was pure genius and transforms it from your typical mac and cheese to something magical.

If you are looking for a artisan-type pizza in the Fairmount/Spring Garden area I don't think you can do better. \n\nDining in at Pronto is an interesting experience. You feel like you are in the dinning room of a take out pizza joint, but the menu is chalk full of great Italian entrees.

Our table of three split the Arugula salad and had a Stromboli, lasagna and the Chicken San Remo (all in the $10-14 range).  We were all pleased with each of these dishes, especially the Chicken San Remo. My only complaint was that the salad was slightly over dressed and all of the dishes were a bit salty. I admit that may be due to my own personal preference. \n\nThe service was great. Our waters were never empty and we were given plenty of attention. The odd part about the whole experience is the setting or ambiance. Although you are eating good food, on nice plates with great service, you feel as if the next person through the door could sit next to you with a grease soaked paper plate eating a slice he just bought at the counter. I imagine the management has made some sort of conscience decision to keep the place like a pizza shop since I'm sure they make a majority of their money through delivery.

Overall the food was excellent, but the experience, not so much. \n\nWhen making my reservation for Valanni during restaurant week I was extremely excited to see the variety of food on their menu. Most places only offer a few options but here there was so much to choose from. This was my reason behind going there, along with the amazing reviews.\n\nBy checking in on yelp I received an offer for a free glass of red or white sangria. I chose the red but received the white instead. Our apps took about an hour to get to us and our actual meal took two hours. By the time we received the third course, dessert, it had been three hours! \n\nIt seemed like something must have happened to cause the food to take so long. I couldn't understand how this could happen while dining at a place that generates such great feedback. Most of all I felt bad for the wait staff because they had to be the front end of it all. The manager was walking around but I didn't see him go up to one table to apologize. Bread was brought out by our server, who was very friendly and apologetic. \n\nOn a much more positive note, the food was EXCELLANT! For my app I had the Crispy Shiitake Polenta, it was by far the best polenta dish I have ever had! I chose the Porcini Crusted Day Boat Scallops for my entree. They were incredible and perfectly seasoned. Last but not least, for my dessert the dark chocolate banana bread pudding. It wasn't too heavy and came with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I originally ordered the mousse but they ran out. All of it was amazing and the portions were satisfying! \n\nOverall I enjoyed the food very much and will be going back again in the future to give Valanni another go!",2,JQvMNDFsvT_njvRgWUir3A

For a starter, I had the antipasti - which was a pretty good blend of hams, cheeses and grilled vegetables - solid but not anything out of the ordinary.  The mains were extraordinary - I ordered the orecchiette with rapini and sausage.  The pasta was perfect - firm but not undercooked, the sausage flavorful and the rapini the perfect complement.

She looked at us like ""do you really need those?!""

No ketchup or anything until we were half-way through the meal when she FINALLY came back around and we asked for the ketchup.  Again, she seemed so confused as to why we would ever want that (there was NO sauce of any type that came with our food...not like they had an alternative and we were just being picky).  Our drinks came out in the tinest of tiny plastic cups and since the waitress never came around, we had to try to make our shots of soda last as long as we could.  \n\nThe crowds were insane but I guess that's to be expected.  They were also broadcasting a post-game radio show fr/our area and the speakers were directly on us so that was pretty awful.

We were both a bit skeptical because we were seated in a far, far dining room with two huge tables with parties of 20+ at each. Based on other reviews we expected to be ignored and never see any meat.\n\nNot the case! Our server Tod arrived almost immediately with the drinks iPad and his recommendations. He was friendly, funny, efficient and informative. He and his co-server were fantastic throughout the night. \n\nWe headed to the salad bar first. The quinoa and edamame and the artichoke salad were my favorites. The prosciutto and salami were also good. Wasn't crazy about any of the cold, cooked veggies.\n\nThe second we sat down the meat showed up and did not stop. We had to turn over our cards several times just to try to get in a bite before the next skewer showed up. I loved the Picanha Nobre (sirloin with garlic, SO good), the salmon with passionfruit sauce, the linguiça sausage, and the bacon wrapped chicken, which was surprisingly flavorful and juicy. \n\nI really wanted this to be a 5 star review because we had such amazing service and food the whole night, but the cocktails were a huge disappointment, especially considering the price. I'm new to Philly, but when you are charging Hollywood drink prices for a watered down beverage, I am not going to be happy about it. We went with passion fruit caipirinhas.

I would have been fine if they were sweet from passion fruit, but there was barely a hint of it in the drinks and you cold barely tell there was cachaca in there. Maybe the bar was over run with orders since the place was absolutely packed, but considering the drinks cost nearly half the price of the meal, they were definitely a waste of money in my book.",0,Y_OJBkFAb1iWtUJDzNXQUg

I drank coffee purely out of utility and was never too worried about the taste. That is until I walked into Greenstreet Coffee one fateful morning. I opted for a cold brew, added a bit of sugar and cream, and went on my way. As I sipped, I was floored by the complex and vivid flavors. Blueberry, Dark Chocolate, and perhaps a little bit of love? My eyes were opened to a whole new world. I naturally returned the next morning, and the next, until Greenstreet had become as engrained in my morning routine as waking up in the first place. \n\nWith time, I began to get to know the wonderful staff and the numerous regulars. Conversations about coffee, music, wizardry, and the neighborhood loonies were plentiful. Greenstreet quickly grew from a place to attain great coffee to a place to spend time with great people listening to great music enjoying great coffee. \n\nI have since moved on from my simple cold brew days, and moved on to silky cortados and shockingly complex iced lychee tea. Every product served at this coffee shop is simply fantastic. \n\nSimply put, no coffee shop besides Greenstreet deserves your time, money, or taste buds.",0,7VUryfj0f7nWvwov-B7ojw

The interior decor is intimate and dimly lit, which makes a great place for a dinner date.  The service was wonderful, no complaints there.  The sushi I must say is very subpar.  Their happy hour menu is actually quite a rip off in my opinion, 5 dollar spicy tuna/salmon rolls but only about 4 pieces.  You inherently can get those rolls at normal price for about 6 to 8 bucks at other tasty sushi restaurants.  I even tried their house special rolls during dinner and was really less than impressed.  In general, sushi at a nice restaurant should NEVER blend the fish, it really takes away the freshness and makes me feel like I'm chewing on food that's been manhandled by 10 people before it hits my mouth.      Sad to say but Wegman sushi is better than this place. The tiny dancer roll was merely overpriced shrimp tempura roll topped with ground up Tuna (presentation was less than desirable).  So that's all the sushi I am going to try from this place.  Overpriced and less than tasteful nor presentable sushi, probably is due to location and decor. \n\nHowever, I will praise their tempura platter on the presentation and it was tasty filled with numerous vegetables (sweet potato, asparagus, broccoli) along with the shrimps.

She told me they couldn't guarantee our 7:30 reservation for 12 people because of an earlier party. Remember, I explained it was a surprise dinner. As it turns out the earlier party sat after paying for an additional half hour. The wait staff could have ""nudged"" by clearing the table, but instead left everything encouraging that party to linger, and left us to lose out.  Surprise ruined. \n2) I asked (the same rude hostess) for separate checks prior to dinner when I called earlier in the day. You may wonder was I rude or obnoxious. The answer is no (I was pleasant until the end of our night. Continue reading). We did not get the separate checks, and when our bill came it was on one check. Fine, we could have figured it out. Not ideal, but better than what happened. But then they proceeded to spend over an hour trying to figure it out and separate the checks. So we finished our meal at 9:55pm and could not pay our bill until 11:00pm. And even then, there were numerous errors. We did offer to divide up the bill ourselves. We left at 11:10pm. Almost 4 hours after we arrived. \nI spoke to the manager Ken about this twice during the meal and got nowhere. So we sat at the table for an hour without any offer by the staff of food or drink.

I would say it is a little over priced for what it is, but seeing that it is a BYOB, they have to make up for that.

We went to the flower show and had reservations for 5:30 but definitely were not going to make it and they had no problem pushing our reservation back to 6:00pm. They were very gracious and nice about it over the phone.\nI had been looking forward to going here for a while. The place is really modern and trendy looking. We were seated immediately and was close enough to a window to watch people passing by but not too close. They also had no problem that in addition to the six of us we had a child as well. My one main issue was that for a party of six or more where we were sitting was not big enough. The table was very small and we constantly had to rearrange things when different courses came out. A combined table in the back would have been nicer space wise, but our area was fine otherwise.\nOur group ordered several different appetizers. I ordered the fiery potatoes and the dips trio with pita bread. The potatoes were not temperature wise but definitely not spicy. The dips were tasty and they even brought more pita out for dipping. Some of my friends also ordered the brussel sprouts, mussels and fried goat cheese. I tried some of the brussel sprouts and they were delicious. I could have easily eaten the whole portion. I did not try the mussels as I'm vegetarian but my friends finished their plates and even asked to keep the sauce to dip with pita as well. The goat cheese appetizer looked great as well but was very small with only three pieces so I did not try but my friend's who ordered it said it was great. Most of us ordered either the meat and seafood, seafood or vegetarian paella for entrees. I had to ask for hot sauce for mine and even my friends agreed something was missing from it. Something about it was lacking and it could use a little more spice or salt, but I felt my meal was healthy and packed with veggies. On the plus side the portions were huge and we all left with our paella for the next day. Two of us also tried the oreo benignets. It was one fried oreo along with ice cream. I do wish there were atleast two oreos on the plate because it was amazing.\nOur server was also very friendly and fast with our service without being overbearing.

The salmon was great and had a citrus glaze over onions.

Maybe they didn't want to add the veggies in it bc it might overcook it bc it is just sitting in a warmer (the curry was premade), but there's no excuse for the lack of flavor in a dish that should be a staple of thai.\n\nMy friend ordered the pad see ewe and it was just ok (I had some of it).

The rest of our party commented that the rice should be at least room temperature but was not. Raw is not inexpensive...in fact it's possibly the most expensive sushi in Philly. One would think that with the exorbitantly high prices the sushi would be made to order. Shame on you Raw!",2,haebF6ELoYWkHcwODPPBmw

My first time I started with a martini that was being featured for Valentine's Day- a chocolate drenched glass paired with a smooth vodka that was a little strong for my taste but still enjoyable. My date and I started with the cheese platter- so good! We paired it with a bottle of wine which I unfortunately forget the name and then ordered the famous lobster and Mac. The plate was a bit small but still delicious. We finished with the Oreo beignet which lives up to the hype, some delicious chocolate mousse and we ordered a dulce de leche dessert, only to be given a complimentary bread pudding since there was a shortage of ingredients- but the pudding was absolutely amazing. Only down side was a wait, but it was a Saturday night before a holiday, no big issue. Second time I tried the Brussels sprouts- amazing and I recommend these to everyone, as well as a flatbread. I also ordered, ""The Ex Boyfriend"" which is a very refreshing martini that has a fruity after taste. I really enjoyed it. I had strawberry tiramisu for dessert and it was a good texture as well as moist but nothing really compares to the original. Lastly, I went for brunch. The seasonal fruit was fresh, the grits were very appetizing as well. I had the stuffed French toast which also had bacon, I enjoyed it. My date had the chunky monkey pancakes that weren't given enough syrup but overall, still well done.",2,9guWlLmYHzyITZfX1dFYrA

We were immediately greeted by a very nice man who we later learned is the owner.  There were 3 or 4 other tables eating, but the crowd seemed appropriate for a weeknight.\n\nThe decor is somewhat generic-modern, but it feels good.  There are a few standout pieces like the wood and pipes on the wall, and the overhead lights.  It certainly doesn't scream ""italian,"" but the food did that.\n\nWe started out with two appetizers (buffalo mozzarella bruschetta and chicken liver crostini) that were presented very nicely and tasted just as good.  Our entrees, the linguini shrimp and lasagna, were full of flavor.  Although normally a relatively plain dish, the shrimp had a great lemon cream sauce and the shrimp and pasta were cooked perfectly.  The bolognese of the lasagna was very flavorful and delicious, and not oilly as many lasagnas are.\n\nIn terms of the food, we had two small disappointments.  Firstly, although the bread was good, it was presented with cold butter in the plastic packets, which was surprising for an otherwise nice restaurant.  The second was the creme brulee dessert.  Although it had a very nice flavor, the bottom half of it (served in a bowl) was cold.  It seemed as if it had been pulled out of a refrigerator and the sugar was thrown on and torched, warming only the top.  The chill hid what was a nice flavor.\n\nThe prices were reasonable and the service was excellent.  Owner Tommy was very helpful and very friendly.  Although the restaurant is unique in South Philly in that it has a non-traditional, small menu and modern decor, the staff provides the friendly feel of a traditional spot.

When I went to this eating establishment, I believe that I was racially profiled by a cashier named Taylor. When my friends and I arrived at Pronto, we were seated in a near empty place. We sat down with a menu to decide what we wanted. After five minutes and after the fact that I had already gotten up to order, the waitress especially came from behind the counter to come over to our table and rudely ask my party, ""Are you ordering something anytime soon?"". I was appalled by her lack of manner in a place where she is trusted to serve customers kindly. After she took my order, I went back to the table and my party said they wanted to leave. So I went back to the counter and asked politely if I could have the pizza in a to-go box. When she pulled out the to-go box, she asked me in the most rude and impolite tone ""are you just going to sit there and eat the pizza straight out of the box?"". I replied ""no, I ordered take out"". Then the waitress said ""chill out ma'am"" when in no shape or form had I raised my voice with her. As my party and I were about to leave, disgusted with the attitude we received at this eating establishment, I asked one of the employees what that waitress' name was, she exclaimed, ""no, because she yelled at me!"". It was clear that the waitress knew she had done something wrong and that she had acted immaturely. \nI came back a day later to speak to the manager and the issue was not resolved. The manager seemed to agree that the waitress' behavior was appropriate and nothing was done to fix the issue. It was clear that the manager was told previously about the issue and was on the side of the waitress. All in all, I had a horrible experience at this establishment and was not satisfied at all with how to manager handled the situation nor did she take me seriously because of my age or race. I will not be coming here again and I hope this review shows just how terribly I was treated at LaScala's Pronto.",6,oFhn9LfSXwfpvrcO8RfP4Q

First of all, the staff in this little bar are amazing!!!!  So pleasant, especially since we were clearly not ""typical"" neighborhood folks.  The evening only got better from there.  We got there just as happy hour was over, but the hostess/waitress gave us menu and said ""go for it"".  Well, my $5 Hurricane was not in the least watered down.  As a matter of fact, I had to wait to get some food in my stomach before I went back to the drink, didn't want to get sick on an empty stomach.  For the happy hour apps, I got the cheese fries and fried oysters.  The oysters were fresh, meaty and fried to perfection.  My sis got the buffalo shrimp and catfish nuggets.  I am not a fan of fish, but those catfish nuggets were good.\n\nThen we waited, and waited and waited for our entrees.  Finally, arrival of the main course.

A college had mentioned this restaurant being featured on the Gordon Ramsay show Kitchen Nightmares.  That alone should have set off alarm bells, but I decided to give it a shot anyway.\n\nWe arrive to an empty restaurant, and it's about 5:45pm, around dinner time.  We are greeted by an older waiter who's eyes were so blood shot I thought he was a damn zombie.  He was all sweaty and clammy.  It was kind of disgusting.  He must have mentioned being on Kitchen Nightmares 7 times from the time he seated us, gave us the menu, and explained the days specials.  Only a little later did I realize he was the owner, given a rather awkward yelling match between him and what I can only assume was one of the chefs.  \n\nSo he comes out and apologizes and offers to comp our appetizers.  It was kind of an odd thing to do for just hearing him yelling, but who cares.. free food right?\n\nSo looking at the food.  OMG.  VERY expensive.  Then I started thinking back on watching those episodes of Hells Kitchen and how you have to pay for quality, but the appetizers were going to be free so that's ok.   \n\nSo I had a chicken dinner that was pretty dry and tasteless.  The saving factor was the appetizer.  The signature salad was really good.  My colleague had a veil dish which she said was good.  They weren't the spectacular dishes I would expect from a Gordon Ramsay consulted restaurant, especially not at those prices, but oh well.\n\nNow here's the kicker, and my next trip to PA won't include another visit of this resturant.  When the waiter slash owner came and gave us the bill, not only was there a manditory 20% tip included in the bill, but so were the prices of the appetizers which he said were on the house for the little ""I'm the owner not you"" power struggle argument he was having with someone in the back.\n\nI didn't want to seem petty, but I figured I would ask him anyway, and see if he forgot.  So we call him over and he denied the fact that he said they were on the house.  I don't know if he was just messing with us at first, but when it became clear he was serious, that's when I took offense, because now he was calling us liars.\n\nI was fully willing to pay for it had he just told me ""Oh sorry I forgot"".  I would have just told him no problem, we will pay for it anyway.  But to deny saying it, in essence, calling us liars?  I gladly paid my bill (which came up to a whopping 64$!), at which he once again mentioned he was featured on the Gordon Ramsay show, as to forget what just transpired 30 seconds earlier.\n\nThe owner was on something that night.  I have never been served like that, ever.",33,zI-QalunKn_0q4ryDnWLyA
rVGxva6cx2eID4ghDLVHJg,0,2016-02-21 19:51:50,0,3l_kE_8hcvfWM_Jsbj7orw,4,"This is a review from Restaurant Week 2016. \n\nWith Restaurant Week, some places offer a tasting menu in addition to their full menu, and some places offer just the tasting menu. 1225 offered both, so we both ordered the tasting menu and an ala carte option.\n\nDrinks: We started off with two of the special drinks that were offered - the week had a liquor sponsorship with Effen Vodka, so we obviously decided that was a good choice. Overpriced? Sure. But expected. My drink was the Cucumber - with was vodka, sake, ginger liqueur, fresh lemon. Tasty. Ms. Ley's was the Pure - vodka, melon liqueur, and fresh lime. I'm sure it was tasty? You'll have to ask her. \n\n1st Course: Salmon Skin Salad - Super crispy and larger than expected for a tasting menu. We both ordered this. My thought going into it was that we would get smaller portions because...it's a tasting menu, and we're served tastes. But they were actual portions, so that was a good surprise, though with sushi options, it meant getting fuller faster. It was all right, but definitely not something I would order again. It was too crispy, too large, the sauce slightly too sweet. I did like the temperature and texture though - warm and soft [underneath the crisp] - and the balance was nice.\n \n2nd Course: Zushi - Ms. Ley ordered the creamy crab meat with ebi [shrimp] choice, and I ordered the yellowtail option. The portions were large - almost too large - and it was awkward trying to eat it without making a certain amount of mess everywhere - the plates, the table, my lap, my coat (?!?). There was care made to the plating of the zushi, though, and it was nice to see the care taken even for a week that may not get as many regulars or experts.\n\n3rd Course: Daylight Combo - An array of tuna, salmon, yellowtail sashimi, spicy tuna hand roll, and I believe a California roll. Again, the temperature and texture were on point - cool sushi (not cold!) on soft, warm rice - so the bites melted in your melt.  Typical sushi fare for the typical easy-going sushi eater. I'm a lover, not a fighter, so while I prefer other types of fish and options for sushi, I'm not going to fight when the option presented is good and the way it should be. The slices of fish were sized well on the pieces of rice - not monster slices on small rice, then having to take multiple bites (the worst) - so that made the love in me happy.\n\n4th Course: Mochi sampler - The risk that comes with ordering mocha samplers are if the first bite of mochi isn't terrific, then it's hard to want to eat the rest, and it goes to waste. Which happened here, for me. I don't care for the red bean, mocha, or certain flavor levels of green tea - which is exactly what options were given. I used to really enjoy mocha, and then it kind of faded. Probably Trader Joe's fault. And the other option, tempura ice cream, is just not my forte. I'll eat it, but I won't go out of my way to find and order it.\n\nA la Carte: I ordered uni with a quail egg and hamachi sushi - which were very, very good. The hamachi was really soft and buttery, pink and room temperature. The rice was carefully made and slightly sweet, which is always a win in my book. The uni, while a little more robust in flavor than I'm used to, was still enjoyable with the delicate sweetness of the quail egg. I broke one of the yolks before eating it, so it got kind of messy on my plate for one of the rolls - usually the yolks are more sturdy, so it may have been placed without the care the sushi was molded, but all in all, it was a good bite to supplement the tasting menu.",0,vlKVmCHhTY5J-I8e2hB7qg

Seriously, you'd think that a place with latte prices higher than Starbucks would have a better, more boutique brand of tea, and more of a selection. Secondly, my apple was stale and mealy. I took one bite and threw it out. The only other fresh fruit option were bananas that were totally brown. I can't believe they had the balls to keep those on the counter. Whoever the district manager is needs to do a serious overhaul of this place. The managers are worse than the cashiers in terms of being lazy, slow and useless.",2,dblMeSI1ohQXU-AjiFFNYg

It wasn't just the extremely over priced meats that upset me( i am also taking into consideration that it is organic and free range ) but also the way how they interacted with customers, those Muslim and non, that had me praying for them. The reason why I stated that it exploits muslims  is that 1) there are no Surahs, Aayah or other words praising/ remembering Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala) on the wall that is always customary for Muslim owners 2)  the workers are extremely rude, they do not respond to muslim greetings and other Arabic sayings for thank you and good bye. As a muslim when u do  halal business with another Muslim you expect to be respected from another muslim/ owner of a store that sells halal things and this is simply not the case here.

gB9c_OMjvGrn36XjHArAUQ,2,2012-09-04 00:39:58,2,QyKiOiGX1sPNYxDxzCeuog,5,"La Scala's Pronto makes me wish I ordered out more often. I have not dined at the restaurant itself, but I have ordered delivery several times. Every time I call to place an order, I am absolutely pleased with how friendly, enthusiastic, helpful, and clear the staff is. The delivery guy is always the same - he is very polite and very friendly. The food itself always arrives very quickly and there has never been a mistake made on any of my orders. Deliveries come complete with plenty of napkins and dare I say, the nicest single-packaged plastic silverware I ever did see. The containers are even nice! I'm not an advocate of over-using plastic where it isn't necessary, but I've done my fair share of recycling these containers over and again by washing them and keeping them around to as tupperware. And they're free!\n\nSure, La Scala's is priced slightly above most other local spots that offer delivery/take out service, but with good reason. I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered and you're treated like a valued customer (which I've found is becoming more and more rare). I can say with confidence that every single item on the menu at La Scala's is significantly better than anything you can order from any other delivery spot around here. The few extra dollars you may spend is totally worth it. \n\nThe La Scala's Chopped Salad has become a ""regular"" for me, I order it every time. The wings are great, they're an awesome light traditional appetizer and not like the greasy, over-sauced wings you'd be served anywhere else. Everything I've ordered from La Scala's is good.\n\nI'm a sucker for dessert, but I don't generally order it when it comes to take out/delivery; I'm not a fan of dry boxed-mix cake that's been sitting in a plastic container for 1+ weeks. However, La Scala's selection of desserts is simply irresistible. They're the kind of desserts you pathetically eat really slow because you never want it to end. I'm not sure if the desserts are prepared on-site (I've never asked), but I'd assume they're made in-house because everything is always fresh and uniquely garnished. Genuinely authentic-tasting Italian desserts.\n\nI love La Scala's Pronto and will remain a loyal customer as long as I live in Fairmount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlso, to address one of the reviews I read by Andrea F: I never ate here when it was Colosseo, so I can't give a taste comparison, but I'm under the impression that the quality of the food was increased significantly once the restaurant changed names/menus, hence the rise in price. Higher quality of product = higher price of product - it's common sense. The strombolis at La Scala's are offered in two different sizes, small ($10) and large ($17), and in my opinion, they're huge regardless of what size you order. I'm assuming you ordered a large ($17), and because of the addition of buffalo chicken, they charged you $3 for a topping, which is specified on the menu itself. Three dollars. That's not a lot for a menu item which is, like you said, essentially an entire large pizza folded in half and sealed, therefore requiring enough buffalo chicken to cover an entire large pizza.\n\nAnd I'm not sure why 45 minutes on a Sunday night is an unusual approximate wait time to you. Sunday nights are one of the busiest delivery nights for restaurants.  Doesn't look like it stopped you from giving the delivery driver a $5.50 tip.\n\nJust sayin'.",4,-_-LWiA2rec6qB7hT9PBFw

Certainly the best I've had so far in Philly. A teeny family owned spot with it's own unique personality. Rybread is the sandwich/pastry/coffee shop you wish you lived near.

It's a little away from the rest of businesses and kinda tucked away in a residential place but that added to its charm.

I learned the hard way many years ago and woke up the next day with a meat hangover.  It made me not want to go back ever again.  But by the time his next birthday  rolled around I was ready to hit Chima up and eat a little more thoughtfully.  \n\nFirst off, you can't eat just meat.  I, of course, thought the salad bar was a waste of my time the first time I dined here and only ate a tiny bit - but now I know you have to eat salad bar to not feel meat-sick the next day.  The meat itself is tremendous.  And they just keep bringing it.  I don't like to create food waste, so I had to keep turning my ""stop/go"" card over and over so I didn't get crazy amounts of meat on one plate.   But then when you know what tastes the best you can make sure they direct that guy over to you more often.  \n\nPersonally, I don't need chicken when I come to Chima.  I want red meat and maybe a tiny but of seafood.  I also love the grilled cinnamon pineapple.  They have different sauces on the salad bar but I didn't think any of the cuts of meat needed it.  \n\nLastly, this year they sent my boyfriend home with delish birthday cake.  I don't remember them doing that any other year but it's possible I didn't mention it on the reservation until this year.",1,DjWTA9NjPrK4y7tfMYSlnA

I wanted to write a few things addressing what my fellow critics have said. I have been to the old ""hole in the Wall"" Minar for years and my family loved the food very much. We did take out mostly because the ambience was not anything great. I got to know the family who runs the business a little bit and I must say they are the most genuine and sweet people you will ever get to know...if you take the time to get to know them....\n\n1. Prices have gone up but compared to the other Indian Restaurants Minar is still the cheapest, tastiest and largest in proportions. Well worth the money any day! My personal favorite the Saag Paneer is well worth 6.95!\n\n2. Kim W. : Minar is and has always been a FAST FOOD restaurant. Don't let the beautiful decor fool you they are still FAST FOOD. They never have claimed to be anything but!  Think of it as a new trend a hybrid if you will. Its like an upscale fast food place. Also, if your looking for chinaware and glasses then you should also expect your chicken tikka masala to be 17.95 rather than 8.95. You never pay for the food in those other ""NICE SIT DOWN"" Indian Restaurants. Your always paying for the plates your eating it on! \n\n3. Jenna M: I must agree with you whole heartedly about number 1 and 2 they have made some significant upgrades from the old Minar. Food is amazing and the decor is outstanding. As far as Mommy Mean-ar I think those comments may be a bit uncalled for a perhaps ignorant on your part. As I stated my family patronized Minar for years and we got to know these kind people. They are not MEAN however the language barrier creates that misunderstanding. The ""mommy"" is the owner's wife and she is very sweet if you actually talk to her. She does not speak great English hence what she does say may not come out as ""nice"" as you wish. Its not rudeness or ignorance is just a lack of English. You should not hold that against her. Coming from an Italian family I can relate how people take what my parents say as rude when in reality they just do not know how to say what they would like to say because of the language barrier. Please give them a chance they are NOT mean people.\n\nI hope this helps to clear the air. I love Minar and will defend it forever !!",3,pUZpmd7qRmooMQ6mxNLppg

We came here originally for restaurant week but it also happened to be happy hour as well. They offer happy hour DAILY from 4-6pm (yes, even on weekends!!), which makes this place even better. We couldn't pass up their $1 happy hour oysters. Oysters were big and such a good deal. There were a lot of other small bites available on their happy hour menu (i.e. crab fingers and crab fries) that we were so tempted to ordered, but we decided to save room for our restaurant week entrees. \n\nAs for restaurant week, I got the TOB caesar salad, the market fish, and salted chocolate bar. Boyfriend on the other hand, got the snapper soup, lobster roll, and shortcake. We shared everything, so I got to taste a bit of each item. \n\nTop dishes from restaurant week were definitely the TOB salad and lobster roll. The salad was crisp,  refreshing, and not overly dressed. The cheese crisps and fried oysters added another dimension of flavor and texture. It's important to note that the salad was more of a knife and fork dish. The greens were pretty big and needed to be cut into smaller pieces to fit my mouth. For the lobster roll, it was pure decadence. No other way to describe it. Probably the second best lobster roll I've had if not the first. The bun was perfectly toasted and buttery. The amount of lobster we got was pretty generous too. Lobster was perfectly meaty and buttery. The fries on the side were full of flavor and was also generous in portion.\n\nThe weakest part of our meal was the market fish and our desserts. My fish was cold and slightly under done in some areas. Dessert on the other hand was decent but nothing to write home about. \n\nThe restaurant was very busy on the Saturday that we came. I could tell they were trying their best to be as attentive as they could. With it being restaurant week, they had a lot of dishes to fire up and serve. Although service wasn't the most attentive, I completely understand given the circumstances. \n\nConsidering everything, would I come back? Absolutely. If not for the lobster roll, I will definitely be back for their happy hour.",0,-A7wqNBMClbU6Y8NNLdMvw

We had already been informed by good friends who have eaten there that it was cash-only and that it was BYOB.  We knew it was a small place and that, undoubtedly, on a Sat night in Philly that it would be crowded and noisy. What we did NOT expect is that when the hostess went to seat us, it was at a table of 8 people with 2 empty chairs! Upon further inspection it was actually 4 tables for 2 diners each that were so closely packed that it looked like a table for eight. My friend and I are both from large urban cities and have no trouble with dining out at tables within close proximity to each other, but here at Mercado the tables were literally divided by LESS THAn 2 inches maximum. This made it very uncomfortable to be essentially having to interrupt six other diners already in the middle of their meals and have them get up in order for us to be seated. When I hesitated and signaled to the hostess that this wasn't going to work for us, she recognized it was an untenable situation and released us  with the wave of her hand. Sorry to cancel a reservation upon arrival but , come on, we didn't come  there to sit on another couple's lap! Ridiculous! I understand the restaurant business works on very thin margins so they want to get as many tables in as possible but there's an inverse relationship between financial acumen and customer satisfaction. We didn't stay for the food, so I can't review it, but if you're looking for a nice meal out on date night where you can actually hear the person you're speaking to - this is not the place for you.",0,852KRovoHjuFneZ3i91pQQ

It was a Reuben that visited America for the first time and was unsure about its identity with its excessive generous amount  of butter on the bread. This Reuben was going through an identity crisis. All the parts were there but somehow it was confused.\n- Mozarella sticks: love the asymmetrical presentation that screamed ""well we tried to make it look good but you're at a divey bar so you only get our efforts."" Your avergae Mozarella sticks with the fried surrounding and an awkwardly distributed amount of cheese. I don't discriminate against mozarella sticks, so I loved them then and I love them now. \n- Margarita: the bar part of the place closes at 2am. I ordered at 1:55. Appreciate the service. \n- Hashbrowns: a group of drunkards offered us some in exchange for my mozarella sticks and an immediate stranger-friendshio was formed in the food trade that felt nostalgically similar to that of elementary children trading their lunch snacks.  \n\nVIBE:\n- **Best thing?

Although General Tsao's doesn't currently have outdoor dining along Sansom Street, we were able to reserve the table at the wide, front window--basically sitting on the sidewalk.\n\nFor our appetizers, we went bao with the Peking Duck Bao Bun (sliced duck, cucumber, lettuce, scallion) and the Pork Belly Bao Bun (pork belly, pickle, peanut). The latter, in particular, had a nice crisp to it, but all four buns (two per order) were fluffy and had a great balance of flavors.\n\nFor our noodle dish (because, noodles!), we ordered Dan Dan Noodles (noodles, minced pork, pickled, vegetable, sesame paste, chili oil) and were happily able to have the minced pork on the side so our vegetarian diner could enjoy.

The Eggplant was delicious--would definitely recommend to everyone, having a deep, rich garlicky sauce. Being my first time eating lotus root, I was pleasantly surprised to find it similar in texture to water chestnut (crispy and fresh) and the sauce had a zing of spice and fresh ginger.\n\nAnd for our entree, we shared the Dry Pot with Fish Fillet, which was served in a small wok over a flame and was absolutely terrific.

We all got into our seats around the relatively empty bar. She tried to greet the bartender but was instantly met with cold accusations that she was ""too hammered to be served"". Remember....this was our first bar and we had not pregamed. We tried to calmly explain to him that it was just her normal personality but he did not believe us. He was about 5'5""-5'7"", pale white complexion, bald, and around age 30. He said his name was Bravo (such an enthusiastic name for a grouchy man). He then proceeded to complain to his other customers and kept coming back to antagonize her every 5-10 min.\n\nNow the reason why I post is this....Approximately 15 min after our arrival around 11:15pm another group of 4 people joined the bar. The gorgeous white female barely made it to the bar and slumped against it holding it for support. She proudly asked for a ""blue moon or anything like it"" and he served her it with a giant smile on his face. Over the next half an hour she also received 2 more shots. Around midnight she passed out on the couch section of the bar. (Feel free to play Where's Waldo if you have a hard time picturing this.

l4YoHcvnsK7ICDrTqL7EEg,12,2019-08-18 02:21:57,6,4tepmUbx0EZqo5GJLwvzqA,5,"OVERVIEW:\nOn the bottom level of the new four seasons, but with enough of a great reputation of its own (from parent restaurant Vernick) comes a new modern seafood-based restaurant. The interior is clean, modern, and is more trendy and less intimate than the original Vernick. As a HUGE fan of Vernick, I had high expectations. I assume I came about a week or two after it first opened, so I wanted to keep that in mind and be fair when rating. We arrived at 5:30 on a Saturday without reservations, and luckily got one of the last remaining high tops. The bar completely filled up within 30 minutes, so I recommend grabbing reservations if you can. \n\nTHE SERVICE:\nFirst, the service. Everyone is very nice but as a new restaurant it seems like they were still getting the flow of things. Our server was super sweet, but she either checked up too many times on us or didn't return at all when we wanted to get the bill. Again, not a big deal as it seems like the staff was getting the small kinks sorted out. \n\nTHE FOOD:\nThe menu offers a lot, but mainly seafood items which I really like. The menu is also aesthetically beautiful, it's this thick blue paper with the drink menu in a pocket on the back. I liked that they use shaved ice in the cocktails I saw, but didn't try any this time. So onto menu, there are separate sections for tartares, small dishes, large dishes, non seafood (pork/chicken/beef all offered) and veggies- plus more like raw fare etc- can't remember it all. We didn't want anything hot, but we did try several hot veggie items...here is my review:\n1. Oysters - tried 2 each of the 3 east coast ones. They rotate I assume but our favorites started with an N. Sorry not useful lol, but all were fresh as one would expect. \n2. Scallop Tartare (from the tartare section) - served with lattice chips, great flavor and portion is decent (not too big) I would order again.\n3. Mushrooms (from veggie section) really liked this dish! Great flavor and presentation.\n4. Salt & Vinegar Potatoes - I am a big potato fan as long as there is flavor- these did it for me. \n5. Tuna & Foie Gras - small portion but delicious. Tuna was very fresh \nDessert (all of which you can view in the glass refrigerator in the middle of the restaurant!):\n6. Tres Leches cake - I've had this dish in many restaurants, here it is one of the best and you can pour the condensed milk to your liking. Stellar dessert.\n7. Carrot Cake Pie - a dense carrot cake that has amazing flavor with a thinner layer of icing. As an icing lover, I still loved this dessert even though it had less icing because the flavor of the cake was so rich, perfectly sweet and embodied the epitome of carrot cake flavor. \n\nOVERALL:\nAs a fan of Vernick, and a lover of seafood, I was pleased to eat here and would return again. As a brand new restaurant, I am excited to see what others think and would want to try the other dishes as everything we had was great. I assume it'll get popular quick, so come here while it's new! Come for date night, catching up with friends, bringing the parents out, or just to eat some high quality seafood. As of this visit, Vernick Fish will be in my mental list of top 10 philly restaurants.",16,Zd2MiIfCHT52WXoUKtYONg

On one side of the rink, they have bales of hay for seating surrounding several pit fire set ups, and if that weren't enough, you can buy a s'mores kit and make your own treats.  A handful of other food and craft vendors are on site for snacking, and for the adults in the crowd, beer and wine are for sale as well.

During my trip I had planned to get out see some of the sights (the historic buildings around Independence Hall, the Rocky Statue, and the University of Pennsylvania just to name a few).  Not wanting to have to walk to a fast food joint for lunch, the hotel conceirge recommended taking a short walk to the market down the street.  Keep in mind that this was my first trip to Philly and so I thought this place was nothing more than a corner grocery store.  Oops.\n\nIf you have never been to Philly but are looking to make the trip, you absolutely must make this part of your itinerary.  This place will absolutely blow you away.  For the record, this a huge farmers market that serves, well, everything.  Italian subs, cheesesteaks, tacos, sausages, burgers, cajun foods, chinese foods, artisan breads, ice cream and yogurt, seafood, hoagies, fresh produce, specialty cheeses and they even have a full service amish bakery.  And thats barely scratching the surface.\n\nI was only in Philly for five days so there was no way to try out all these places, but I can tell you what I did have was all good.  Carmen's Hoagies were delicious, the Little Thai Market has outstanding chicken dishes, Olympic Gyro had a tremendous Pita sandwich and Beiler's Amish Bakery had an apple dumpling dessert that was out of this world!  In all I think I only had 3 or 4 meals during my trip that didn't come from the market.  For those of you who enjoy farmers markets, this place is the creme de la creme of farmers markets.  \n\nA couple of pieces of information for you if you decide to make the trip.  First, bring cash.  Some of the vendors take debit or credit, but most that I encountered only took cash.  Second, check the Reading Market website for hours for each vendor as they all have different schedules.  Usually a late lunch is a good time to go as the crowds aren't as thick and most of the vendors are still open.  Third and lastly, this is the perfect place if you want to try out true Philly food.  There's other famous spots in town, but if you're crunched for time like I was, this place has all the Philly staples you'd expect.  Pretzels, cheesesteaks, hoagies, you name it.\n\nIf you're in Philly and looking to sample some fresh local faire, it doesn't get much better than this.

Iovine Brothers Produce - Even at the cheapest of supermarkets, I couldn't get a whole bag of the freshest, highest quality vegetables for $5. Same goes to the nuts and snacks on the southern wall, where else can you buy them in such a state of quality at such prices?\n\n2. Godshall's Poultry - Instead of the yellowed, hormoned chicken you get from the supermarket, these are the freshest, tastiest chicken you can find in the city. And fresh chickens do make a difference in taste. Of course, they do have ducks, quails, turkeys and eggs.\n\n3. Martin's and John Yi's is where I get my meat and seafood, Martin's is always a few bucks cheaper and John Yi captures me with their neon signs.\n\n4. 4 Seasons Juice Bar has the tastiest fruit smoothies and blends around. My favorite is Pineapple (for sweetness) + Banana (for texture) + Orange (for taste). Nothing beats a 20oz No.4 in a hot summer day.\n\n5. For your dessert needs, Flying Monkey has the best cupcakes and lemon bars in town. Termini Brothers has a killer chocolate covered banana on a crescent cookie. You can also visit the ladies at Famous 4th for a fresh baked cookie. For something completely evil, you can go to the Amish bakery for a cinnamon roll with nuts AND frosting.\n\n6. Shanghai Gourmet's American Chinese food is as good as any place in Chinatown. Try their fried rice or the Shrimp in Lobster Sauce, it's not on their menu but the jumbo shrimps in the silky luscious sauce is to die for. (gulp)\n\n7. The Spice Terminal will fulfill most of your gourmet needs. Bee Natural has a wide variety of honeys. For cheese and charcuterie, you can visit Salumeria and if not for anything else, go to By George for their pasta sauces, they'll even sell you pizza dough if you want to make something at home. \n\nIt's a vibrant place with lots of other places to discover and it's a great place to walk and browse when you have the time. Just don't stand in the middle of the aisle and block traffic, it can be crowded. Cell phone reception can be on the low side, and it's hard for the working folks to pick up groceries on their way home since most of the shop will close business around 5, but there's the weekend. The Amish generally won't be there from Sundays to Wednesdays but most shops open Mondays to Saturdays and some even open on Sundays.",5,jQF9CqbIfpQit9B0MAG4Wg

My fiancee's mom, who doesn't like to upset people, was so flustered that she ordered the full portion salmon instead. ""I felt so intimidated,"" she told me. I did not have those qualms - so I walked up to the waiter and asked if we could change it to the half-portion risotto. He refused, saying now that it was ""policy.""

The market is generally packed with customers and tourists so navigating through the narrow corridors is often hard. There is often long lines at the more popular stands. \n\nOne complaint I did have however, was for the cleanliness of the dining tables and seating areas.

Keep in mind that ""market"" is a misnomer, as what Reading Terminal is, is an amazing court with a congregation of suprisingly many good food stalls.  It's not a Pike Place market, or a St. Lawrence Market, but it is it's own unique, awesome food paradise.  I don't get why we don't have anything like this in NYC (no, Essex Market doesn't cut it - what a joke).  If I lived in Philly, I would be here every day.\n\nThis may not be the place for gourmet diners, because it really is just a bunch of food stalls put together.  It's a place where you can get crepes, pastrami, emu eggs, honeycombs and Amish bread in one place.  You could buy meats and groceries here, but I'm not sure that's the focus here, unless you want Amish meats, which are good quality and cheap.  Bathrooms are not bad - Pike Place bathrooms are worse.\n\nPro-tip:  anyone can go into the beer garden, even kids, and you can bring food in.  The only rule is one drink per person (which includes sodas).  So instead of paying $1.70 for a fountain drink outside, might as well use pay the same amount at the beer garden and get a table too.\n\nParking is $28!

The market has some new stalls but its overall vibe (meat and fish heavy unhealthy Philly fare) has not. \n\nI still enjoy a stroll through the market (so long as my gaze avoids the meat and seafood stalls) but those walks are just nostalgia for my first years in Philadelphia when my wife and I were first dating. Way back then (the ancient era of 2004-2005) she and I would go to the market for a the special at the Hatfield Farms deli counter. Back then whenever I had time to kill, I would do it at Reading Terminal Market.\n\nAs my tastes have changed the Market has barely budged. It feels stuck in a past where people ate like they did not give a damn. Maybe I'm being too hard here. It could just be my age. I loved the market in my 20s. In my 30s, I usually only order something from the Four Seasons veggie juice bar. \n\nI recently sat at a table at the Market to grade some student work before I met up with some friends. As I was sitting with my Four Seasons juice I was asked to take part in a survey by a woman researching for Reading Terminal Market. My overall feedback to her: ""this could be such a great place and I would recommend it to friends if only it had some vegan take-out!""\n\nTo be fair: Reading Terminal Market has the vegan cupcake at Flying Monkey (quite good) and Molly Malloy's which is not a bad place to hang out. And of course Four Seasons for some really good cheap veggie juice.\n\nAside from that and coffee I don't spend money there.

The Aztec soup my grandmother had for $5 was better.\n\nShe ordered the carne asada ($16). I only noticed that they hadn't asked her the temperature when it came to the table well done.

The whole meal was so good, the next time I come I'm not looking at a menu or listening to their specials, I just want them to surprise me with whatever they choose.\n\nGreat meal start to finish at a great price point, can't wait to return.",0,zfDG3229XSu5xZYc-AZNvw

It's like a food court/farmer's market on steroids. \n\nWe walked through the entire place to check it out and decide where we wanted to eat. We decided on Olympia Gyros (for the guys) and the falafel place (for me). I got my meal quickly, a falafel platter with falafel, salad, pita, hummus, and tabboulah. I also got a tropical smoothie. All of this for about $12. One thing that confused me is that you get your food and eat, THEN pay. I wanted to carry mine away so I could eat with the people I was with, so I asked for the bill and then headed out.\n\nEverything was fresh and tasty. I especially appreciated the smoothie - they were juicing the fruits right there. The guys liked their gyros and fries too. The lady working there was nice as she let me sit and eat even though I hadn't bought my food there, and even cleared my trash for me.\n\nThe amounts of meat and seafood here were crazy. I have never seen so much. Lots of produce - I can imagine even more when the summer comes around. Some standout booths were:\n\n- a shop dedicated entirely to cookbooks. Cookbooks unlike I've ever seen before, for everything under the mood and more. \n\n- A honey shop, with products made from honey, plus several varieties to buy\n\n- COOKIES. PLEASE, Yelp Philly, help me out here. We bought cookies from a place that had very unique flavors, like caramel and raspberry chocolate. Some of them were available halfway dipped in chocolate. They were the best cookies I've ever tasted. I can't remember the name of the shop, and wanted to see if they are online for me to order. I checked the webpage but none of the bakeries ring a bell. I think they sold more than cookies. I'm desperate! Please PM me! \n\nWe spent more than enough to get our parking ticket validated. $4 for 2 hours was a great deal, seeing the prices of parking if you didn't have it validated.

This is a working man's breakfast providing you with the carbs and protein to get you through the morning until lunch. The sausage and eggs were just the perfect breakfast and the rest just reminded me of New Orleans. Rating: 5/5\n* Breakfast Po Boy is a French baguette with choice of fried eggs, melted cheese, andouille sausage, turkey sausage, or ham. These were the perfect sandwiches with just the right amount of bread to fillings. The turkey sausage had a light texture but flavorful. The Andouille sausage reminded me of a Hawaiian Portuguese sausage and eggs breakfast. I was in heaven! Rating: 5/5\n* Beignets (served on Sundays and Wednesdays) are French doughnuts/fritters served hot and topped with confectioners' sugar. Beck's makes the most authentic beignets outside of Louisiana. They have a beautiful golden brown crust and just the right consistency inside, not too dense and not too fluffy. If you've eaten beignets at Café du Monde in New Orleans, you will absolutely love these! Rating: 5/5\n* Chicken and Andouille Gumbo is something my mom had to try. She loves gumbo and is certain this gumbo was made with love. The color is dark with the vegetables cooked down to their essence to flavor the gumbo base. The chicken and sausage add the meaty texture and flavor to the mix. Rating: 4.5/5\n* The Alligator Sausage Po Boy is topped with caramelized onion, peppers, and creole mustard. The alligator sausage is mild and lends itself well to the sweet flavor of the peppers and onions and the robust creole mustard. Rating: 4.5/5\n* Fried Oyster Platter is served with corn bread and choice of red beans & rice, white rice, or Cajun fries. The oysters were meaty and fried to a perfect golden brown with crispy outside and slightly briny and creamy on the inside. The red beans & rice was fantastic with nice pieces of sausage. Rating: 5/5\n* Muffaletta is salami, ham, mortadella, sharp provolone, and olive salad served on Italian bread. My husband and I used to make this sandwich every day at Café Orleans in Disneyland. Beck's version was much better as there is more meat and cheese and they sandwich the olive salad between the meats which keeps the bread from getting soggy. We took these with us to the airport to enjoy before our return flight. The flavors of the different meats is just amazing and the olive salad had just the right amount of acidity to bring the sandwich together. The bread was very rustic with crunchy outside and tender yet chewy inside. Rating: 5/5\n\nBeiler's Bakery: \n* Apple Snitz Fry Pie is reminiscent of the Hostess handheld pies but tastes more homemade with a buttery crust and slow-cooked apple pie filling. They only make them on certain days so if you see them, buy a bunch. We missed our chance to load up before we headed back home. Rating: 5/5\n* Chocolate Whoopie Pie looks like a mini flying saucer with chocolate cake on the outside with frosting in the middle. The chocolate cake was marvelous with rich chocolate flavor and soft, spongy texture. The frosting in the middle was fluffy, creamy, and not overly sweet. They were so good, we brought a dozen home with us. Rating: 5/5\n\nSalumeria: They had beautiful French pates, cheeses, and meats. We picked up some imported prosciutto, capicola, Swiss, and provolone to make picnic sandwiches in the hotel room for lunch. The prosciutto had a grassy essence blended with the aroma of aged cheese. The closest taste and texture comparison upon eating some is that it's like butter with a salty porkiness and almost obscene. Unfortunately, my work day had not yet ended or I would have enjoyed a glass of Rosé to complete the food experience. Rating: 5/5\n\nDutch Eating Place is a diner of sorts serving breakfast and lunch next to Beiler's Bakery. Since seeing Andrew Zimmern making and tasting scrapple, I had to have some. Dutch Eating Place served a Scrapple and Egg breakfast. I was so excited to finally try it and it was wonderful! If you like pork and liver, you'll love this. It is pork scraps mixed with cornmeal, wheat flour, and spices, like a savory pork cake. It fries up really well with a crispy outside and almost pate-like texture inside. Every meat vendor in Reading Terminal Market sold variations with pork, beef, and even turkey. Again, I wish I had a refrigerator in my room so I could have brought some back with us. Rating: 5/5\n\nMiller's Twist serves up hand-rolled Amish-style hot buttered pretzels. Man vs. Food's Adam Richman stopped by during his visit of Reading Terminal Market. You can watch as they roll and artfully twist pretzels. They also wind these beautiful pretzels around full size and mini hot dogs. The pretzel is golden brown with a beautiful glaze on the outside. The interior is chewy and works well with the hot dog. The mini dogs are two-biter and perfect to share as a snack. Rating: 5/5",4,aGUZKSRPA-MHHj6b8GhOww

It goes without saying that this triple whammy made for a very crowded and chaotic experience. There was barely room to move and navigating between stalls may have involved the tactful use of elbows. \n\nNow, aside from the crowds, Reading Terminal is AMAZING. Craving something? Reading Terminal probably has it. There's an incredible selection and most things are very well priced so come hungry! We were only able to hit three places before getting full. \n\n12th Street Cantina- Veggie Quesadilla with chips and guacamole. The veggie quesadilla was great and the guacamole was sublime. You can tell that it is made fresh. Don't forget the napkins because eating this can get messy! Overall, I was very happy with my selection. \n\nIndian place that starts with an N (totally forgot the name)- only grabbed a potato samosa here but they have many of your typical Indian food options. The samosa was bland and disappointing. It was also wrapped in puff pastry vs the usual samosa shell which would've been okay had the filling been more flavorful. \n\nMeltkraft- I love grilled cheese. Meltkraft has sooo many options from the filling to what fat to grill your sandwich in (duck fat? Truffle oil? Garlic rub?) We decided to get the basic grilled cheese with added jalapeños. The cheese itself was very very good but after grilling the sandwich was a bit oily. I also would've liked more jalapeños in the grilled cheese. Almost an entire half of my sandwich was jalapeño-less. But the cheese was on fleek",2,9YTDuRDjuuJwLofCBeZiIQ

Today I ordered the same thing but the feta was tiny crumbles and there was a huge pile of oil in the middle of the hummus.  Also, my husband ordered the chopped salad.  When it came out it looked like a plate of salsa.  It was soaking wet and the mixed greens looked like old, soggy, iceburg.  I asked the bar tender if the salad was made incorrectly, he said no.  In CHOPS' defense, the manager did take it off the menu, but not before telling me it was one of their top sellers.  How could this be?  You almost needed a spoon to eat it.  I got the chopped kale salad, it wasn't bad.

My favorite is still the shaved brussel sprout salad and the volcano chicken on butter lettuce wraps. The serving size is typical tapas, which is a shame considering how slightly expensive most of the dishes are. The biggest disappointment for me were the peppers and eggplants. Both were highly reviewed but the peppers were not spicy at all, and just salty, and the eggplant was still a bit too raw. However, the crown of the evening went to the complimentary frozen souffle.

They have great groceries, amazing desserts, and random little stalls that offer everything from earrings to honey chapstick. I'll break this down more\n\nGroceries: I go to reading terminal for groceries as much as I can. I've been able to find everything, and for cheaper/fresher, except for milk and pasta. I always get my fruits and vegetables from ""ok produce."" They generally sell berries for $.99 to $1.99, and small bags of eggplant, apples, mushrooms, cauliflower, etc. for the same price ($1-$2). I'll get two full bags of fruits and vegetables and spend less than $10. Produce is always a good buy as well. Whether I need mussels, oxtail, or chicken I'm always guaranteed to get a good buy (and with multiple fish and meat markets you can take your pick). \nThere's also a spice/dry goods store that I LOVE. I buy loose leaf tea, spices, and lentils/other grains all the time. Again, super cheap and very varied.\n\nFood: The food is just ok. It's cool that they have pretty much any type of food you might want, but it's definitely not the best quality. The Indian food is underwhelming and the flavors are never on point, Japanese food is American Japanese and again not that great, but the soul food is pretty good. I wouldn't go to reading for the soul food alone, but if I have to eat there that's usually what I'll get. I'd recommend getting groceries and snacks in reading, and then eating in chinatown. \n\nSnacks/dessert: Beilers donuts are fresh rolled and amazing, reading terminal has addictive cannolis, and any of the bakeries has great croissants and other baked goods. I come to reading purely for the cannolis when i get cravings",0,CcqpZkc5ngs88akzQ0rFHg

I also tried my mother-in-law's brunch burger which she ordered medium instead of medium rare (TSK TSK!). The burger still had a great complimenting flavor of egg, meat and cream cheese. Overally I really enjoyed my time at Tria. Will definitely keep that on my brunch list.",1,Ygi1otJvXe_RLyIAVulsEQ

Everyone who has visited Philly before recommended me to visit this amazing market.\n\nWe were here on a Saturday morning around 10am. I had a couple of restaurants in my list : one for Scrapple and the other for roast pork sandwich. I was lucky to try them both. Scrapple is a local Philly food made of all the scraps of a pig. It does not sound enticing but when cooked right it's extremely delicious. I had scrapple from Down Home Diner. This place is pretty crowded. I waited in line for 15 mins to get seated. I finally got my scrapple after 30 mins wait. Although people like it with maple syrup I personally prefer the ketchup. Roast pork sandwich at Dinic's sandwich place was really good too. \n\nReading market is insanely huge. Walking around all these local restaurants can be overwhelming. They have almost every cuisine that you can imagine. I also found something that I actually wasn't looking for. Egg puffs at the Indian restaurant made my day. It's our local Indian savory food and it had been over 3 years since I had a egg puff. I was over the moon when I found it here. \n\nI definitely recommend you to go through the list of restaurants that are at this market because it's just a lot to go there and decide where you want to dine. \n\nFor the unlucky ones who planned to visit this place on a Easter Sunday, I feel bad for them as the market was closed.",2,qQklYBau8yXqpCfng5kTYw

ytynqOUb3hjKeJfRj5Tshw,4,2019-08-27 14:01:35,2,QiDkvBba-NZeCirlx_bxww,4,"At the time of writing this review, Reading Terminal Market (pronounced ""Redding""), has over 5,100 Yelp reviews. That's a lot. It's easily one of the most-reviewed places I've visited. It's one of those popular ""public"" markets with a food hall and a bevy of vendors selling everything from fresh produce and flowers to handmade crafts and jewelry. A lot of big cities have them. Comparable markets include Chelsea Market in New York, the Ferry Building in San Francisco, and Pike Place Market in Seattle. In Atlanta, where I'm from, Reading Terminal Market (""RTM"") reminds me most of Sweet Auburn Curb Market. New developments have popped up around the country in recent years that try to emulate a sort of old-school municipal market feel.\n\nRTM is different because, unlike its newer counterparts, its atmosphere is genuine and not manufactured. The market opened in 1893, making it one of the country's oldest. Some of the market's vendors have been around since the very beginning, over 100 years, like Bassetts Ice Cream. You can find them just inside one of the 12th Street entrances on the west side of the market. This is where we entered.\n\nThis is a Philadelphia hot spot and one of the most recommended places for out-of-towners to go. We visited over the weekend and the market was crowded with tourists and locals alike. It should definitely be high on any foodie's Philly to-do list. There are so many food stalls here and the selection is eclectic, from Amish-style rotisserie chicken, sourced regionally, from Dienner's Bar-B-Q Chicken to Peking duck from Sang Kee Peking Duck (an RTM outpost of a Philly Chinatown favorite).\n\nIn all, there are over 80 vendors packed onto one floor. They're classified into the following categories: bakeries, beverages, dairy & cheese; housewares, books, crafts, etc; meats & poultry, Pennsylvania Dutch (note the PA Dutch vendors are closed every Sunday), produce, restaurants, seafood, and specialty foods. The market is laid out in a grid with four large aisles going north-south, and 11 smaller aisles going east-west. There are a handful of communal seating areas (almost all seats were taken during our visit), restrooms (clean enough), and an attended welcome booth if you'd like to pick up a map and/or ask for recommendations. Some of the vendors also have their own dedicated seating.\n\nA few recommendations:\n\n1. Roast pork sandwich at Tommy DiNic's Pork & Beef. Perhaps the most popular vendor here. They offer wraparound counter service.\n\n2. Pretzel from Miller's Twist. These are fresh-made, Amish-style pretzels. They're also known for their cheddar-jalapeno pretzel dog and breakfast foods. (Note: Miller's Twist is a PA Dutch vendor and is closed on Sundays.)\n\n3. Scrapple from Down Home Diner. Also known as Pannhaas by the PA Dutch, this is basically pork scraps made into a savory pate. Reminds me of the Neese's liver pudding (livermush) I ate growing up in North Carolina.\n\nSurprisingly, there's not really a well-known or recommended vendor for cheesesteaks here though there are some who sell them (e.g. Carmen's Famous Italian Hoagies & Cheesesteaks). Bring cash because some vendors, like Carmen's, are cash-only. A couple places that caught our eye that we didn't get to try were Pearl's Oyster Bar and Mueller Chocolate Co. (featured on Food Network).\n\nThere are two parking garages, one at 12th and Filbert (Parkway Garage) and the other at 11th and Arch (Hilton Garage). Signs posted at each entrance to the market advertised 2-hour discount parking with $10 market purchase and validation at the vendor.\n\nIf you're pressed for time in Philly, Reading Terminal Market is a great place to visit since there are so many vendors all in one place. If you're from out of town, be sure to visit the northwest corner of the market where all the PA Dutch vendors are located. They're unique.",9,j14WgRoU_-2ZE1aw1dXrJg
ytynqOUb3hjKeJfRj5Tshw,2,2011-07-03 15:18:21,2,deETyYRnCVAqa0DsCQjeag,4,"After living in Philadelphia for over 6 years how on God's green earth is this the first time I've ever been to Reading Terminal Market? My only regret is that I didn't find out about this place sooner. Oh how I wish I had known about the wondrous treasures tucked inside this well disguised market full of fabulousness when I worked just 5 blocks away. My taste buds would love me but my backside (and perhaps my husband) might not have enjoyed the consequences of my overindulgence. \n\nBelieve them when they say this place is packed on the weekends.  The little old lady I almost ran over with my stroller can atest to this.  IN true Philly fashion she shot me a dirty look, mouthed some expletives and kept it moving.  Other than that , how could you not love this place? For starters, there are approximately 75 vendors in this locale so even the pickiest of people should be able to find SOMETHING they enjoy (Unless they're from NYC, then all bets are off because you know NYC has thee best of everything *insert eye roll*). The place is cramped, let's just put that out there. They say 100,000 people come through the market per week but honestly it feels more like 100k per day. You're sure to trip over tourists stopping and gawking in the aisles as local people trying to pass by get annoyed (sorry Grandma). Grab yourself a Tenant Directory (from either a bathroom or the market information booth) and it will help guide you to wherever your interests may take you. The directory divides businesses into the following categories: \n\n*Bakeries \n*Beverages \n*Dairy & Cheese \n*Flowers & Plants (one vendor) \n*Housewares, Books, Crafts, etc. \n*Meats & Poultry \n*Seafood \n*Pennsylvania Dutch \n*Produce \n*Restaurants \n*Specialty Foods \n\nBe advised that 30% of the tenants are closed on Sunday, this includes ALL of the Dutch Merchants (they only work Wed-Sat).   The market itself is open 8 to 6 from Mon-Sat and 9 to 5 on Sun.  \n\nTreat yourself to a delicious pretzel (and fresh lemonade) at Miller's Twist. \nGet the famous apple dumpling at Dutch Eating Place. \nIf you're into the Oprah hype, stop by Delilah's for the ""best ever mac & cheese"" (I can't attest to that and hell, Oprah looks like she'll eat anything to me so I don't know if she's exactly a qualified food source) \n\nYou'll find Asian cuisine, Soul Food, Ice Cream, baked teats, cheesteaks, and everything you need to get the complete Philadelphia experience. \n\nPark anywhere in the Parkway Garage at 12th & Filbert Streets and park for $4. \nBring your parking ticket to the market with you and after making a purchase of $10 or more ANY merchant will validate your ticket (upon request). \nYou automatically receive flat rate of $4 for UP TO 2 hours of parking (anything over that and you're subject to the astronomical garage rates). \n\nIf you're not in for a drive just take the train. You can exit either rail line at 13th street, head east towards 12th street and make a left onto 12th. You can't miss the signs and you won't want to miss the food!",1,v40lA__-5DYjdurztH6uyw

I love doing my grocery shopping here cause I can get a lot for almost nothing. \n\nWhen you come here park in the parking lot that is on 12th street right across from the 12th St market entrance. If you park here you get 2 hrs of parking for $4 with a $10 purchase at the market. Just make sure to get it validated inside - you'll definitely spend $10.\n\nOK Produce, located right in the center of RTM (next to DiNics) is a great place for a college student on a budget to grab produce. They mostly sell dollar bags of produce that you then can slap the 10% student discount on. This place might not have the most quality produce but you get a bang for your buck. Iovine Brothers has nicer produce but you definitely pay for it. \n\nThe Amish are not usually there Sunday-Tuesday so if you go then you are playing your luck to get some of their tasty treats. They run a lot of shops with Reading Terminal and you are honestly missing out if you don't get something from Beiler's Bakery. Some of the best donuts in town. I also like their Mac n Cheese from the Rib Shack. Definitely worth trying! Also, I recommend going early the day before Thanksgiving and grabbing a pie from the Amish.\n\nAll the way in the back is the Nut Shop *or something along those lines* that sells coffee, rice, snacks, and tea in bulk. You pick out what you want and drag the bin to the front and ask the nice people behind the counter to weigh it out for you. It's definitely a good deal on a bunch of staple things. Plus they have some snacks that I used to get in my Naturebox *which I have now unsubscribed to*. It's definitely a good place to check out. \n\nThe final place I want to mention is Meltkraft. If you are a lover of Grilled Cheese, you gotta check it out. This is one of the most satisfying meals in the market and they are always have a specialty sandwich. Plus, each order comes with homemade chips. yum. \n\nAll and all, I am a huge Reading Terminal fan.

This place is lacking. We ordered 2 chicken biriyanis, 1 aloo paneer roll and 1 chicken pepperwala roll. Pros: Yelp 10% discount; portions were good; rice and/or meat portion was adequate per order; roti soft; cool roti maker; food hot; kati rolls decent; good box for rolls; prices reasonable. Cons: biriyani is lacking all traditional flavors and spice- i hate having to recook any food. I had to with some indian spices. We Indians like our traditional Indian food.  Give spice choices to everyone but if you say the dish is spicy, taste it and make sure you are correct. Use traditional biriyani masala.

That said, the Reading Terminal Market is a must-visit if you are in Philadelphia. I have tried different food from a number of the restaurants within the Market, and have almost always had a positive experience. In general, I would recommend that you do some research and get your food to go, especially if you are in the area for a conference and are staying nearby. I recommend the croissants at Market Bakery, Beiler's donuts, and a visit to Mueller's chocolate store. The Market is also a good place to get groceries.

The whole dining experience was well worth the wait. I'd like to note the $100 pp discussion - with the quality of the service and food I understand it. If you can't respect their policies, don't eat here, plain and simple. \n\nFor starters we had the oysters and shrimp and calamari appetizer. The oysters were so meaty and fresh  and I could definitely say they're the best I ever had. Comes with 5 condiments to eat with and as a person who loves sauces this really made them that much better. The shrimp and calamari were also delicious, the seasoning reminded me of Popeyes which I'm a huge fan of and this dish also came with 3 different sauces which were all so good!\n\nFor my main course I had the sea bass with the bread crumbs on top. The portion was huge! Sea bass is usually a lighter fish but this was so heavy and tender that I had to take it home. So much flavor and depth. For sides - we got the creme brûlée cream corn (omg, don't come here without getting that), truffle fries, mash potatoes, and creamed spinach. All the sides were amazing as well. \n\nLastly, for desserts we got the key lime pie and deep fried banana split. The key lime pie was a little heavy and was more of a cheesecake if anything. Would skip that next time. But the banana split... wow. One of the best desserts I ever had. The maraschino cherry whipped cream on top was the star. \n\nOur server Porsha and her helper were so personable and down to earth and made that experience that much better. We really felt welcomed here! \n\nOnly negative was the music didn't match the vibe. Other than that, the whole experience was 10/10. Can't wait to come back.",0,5a-3jw_SxqpVjL2C65lslA

There seems to be a lack of late night food options around this area, and masala kitchen definitely helps fill in that emptiness. Their specialty is the Kati roll, which is a paratha wrapped around meat or paneer. Here are a couple of my favorites from MK:\n\nPaneer Masala roll -- although I'm not vegetarian, I prefer paneer over chicken because it has a softer texture, making it easier to bite into the roll without pulling half of the fillings out. It's pretty flavorful, and one roll is filling enough for a late night snack. The rolls come with a yogurty white sauce (perfect for balancing out the heat in the roll) and a spicy red sauce. \n\nMango lassi: where else are you going to find a cool mango drink in the middle of the night? This is definitely a must have if you're already in the restaurant. \n\nBasically, masala kitchen is quickly becoming my favorite place for late-night eats.

saVXla5i8TjE51S5uCaf6w,0,2021-07-21 10:05:25,0,n_6hMVGRBT5-uiVk_SCXRA,4,"We decided to find out what's all of the hype about with Steak 48. \n\nHere it is:\n\nLet's start with the food was delicious, and was priced appropriately for a steakhouse. The $100 minimum per person was very easy to achieve, we actually spent about $250 per person. (Total bill with tip ~$1,100-four people). \n\nWe were seated in the main dining room with the open air kitchen. I believe that I counted 16/18 tables. The area, is OK!  I did not find the ambiance special, especially given what we spent for the evening. It was about the food and the company- but the basic open area seating was not special...very basic. \n\nThe main server and table team was good, although I don't remember the server's name. We expect great service when we dine at any establishment, so it takes a bit more than doing your job to wow us! What we DO appreciate and what would have made the dining experience better is the chef or manager stopping by the table.  A brief introduction and check in on the overall meal, and/ or dining experience would have been a nice touch. That did not happen. \n\nHere are my interesting observations:\n\n1) I was curious why the establishment felt the need to publish a dress code. Barclays Prime, Del Frisco's Double Eagle or Jean-Georges do not find the need to ""over communicate"" what attire is required. Yet Steak 48 does. Well, I observed some very interesting, inappropriate attire being wore by women. (Attire fit for a strip club or a low scale night club). It made me pause, and think to myself ""why?"".  We are foodies and have dined all around the city and I've not seen THIS in other high end-well appointed establishments. (Perhaps I've overlooked elsewhere; Steak 48 has open seating to left and right in the main dining room so partons essentially walk through the center aisle to be seated). None the less, I believe it can be handled by not allowing entry. It's distracting and detracts from the dining experience. \n\n2) As noted, the menu is appropriately priced-nothing extreme. Which again, made me question the real reason for publishing a minimum spend. It seems like it may be to price a profile of customer out that does not meet the brand/ image the establishment is looking to achieve. However, based on our observation- it wasn't working and people have plenty of money to spend (with inappropriate attire and all) to say they have been someplace that's popular. \n\nRecommendation: find a better way to express whatever message you are trying to get across to your customers. It ""cheapens"" the establishments brand, especially at $100. \n\n3) As we were leaving, we decided to get a photo on the steps. Now there is NOTHING special about these steps. It was the only open, lighted area besides the table to memorialize the moment. (The ""lobby"" was so dark- I thought I was walking through a haunted house until we passed the steps headed to our table). Nonetheless, a gentleman-Tony, graciously reached for our phone to take the photo. Initially, we thought that he was a friendly customer. Nope, he was security. His job was to watch over the stair case and make sure people were not coming in simply for a photo opportunity on the staircase. Again-odd. Nice steps, but in my opinion, nothing to talk about-simply a better lit area. \n\nNet, the food was good. If we return, we would absolutely request a private booth with the glass enclosure or a small semi private room. We prefer a complete experience to compliment the food. \n\nWishing this establishment all the best as it finds its place among a few giants in the city!",4,uwTOZUnu_Q6pmJFz1GeYwQ

If you can't find it here, you ain't looking hard enough. \nI have been coming here for far longer than I care to admit.  My mother used to drag me around the market back when it was the old Reading Terminal,  complete with the leaky roof and the floor was coated with sawdust.  There were carcasses hanging on hooks of every edible animal imaginable, some animals wtere still alive,  waiting for the axe.\nIt was unbelievable!  My mom made me sit with her and drink buttermilk at Spataro's, we ate with the Amish and had ice cream at Bassett's. \nLater in life,  I worked near the RTM and if I didn't visit there everyday,  I got a bad case of the shakes. I was there so much,  some of the vendors thought I had an apartment upstairs. They called me KYW because I was there two, three, four times a day. \nThe RTM is different now, it's a kinder,  gentler market, shinier,  brighter and much more diverse.

I made reservations over a month in advance for my boyfriend's birthday and was anxious about everything being perfect.  When we arrived at 7:30 and our table wasn't quite ready which wasn't a huge deal.  We hung out by the doors and they brought us champagne for the inconvenience.  Plus one. \n\nOnce we were seated I loveeeed our table. There was glass blocking behind each long side of the table and a wall flanking the short end of the table so it was like a private cubby.  The only way to see us was on the side of the table where are server would appear.  \n\nAutumn served us and she was perfect in every way.  Her obvious mastery of the menu and comprehensive descriptions made it easy to choose the best dishes for us. My bf was very happy with the birthday card the restaurant gave him, he turned to me and said ""awww it has my name on it."" LOL \n\nSo the food...yes we came to a steak restaurant to eat seafood. Sue me.  We ordered the fried lobster appetizer, jumbo crab cakes, pan seared scallops, corn creme brûlée and whipped potatoes topped with lobster and crab meat.  We also had two glasses of rosé.  Every single thing we ate was outstanding.  We finished the night with the warm vanilla cake as the birthday finale. And this was probably the best food I've eaten in years.  It was well worth the price tag.\n\nI know there is controversy over the service minimum and dress code but I would frequent this establishment any day of the week.  Perhaps management might consider one or two (slower) days in the week when the mimimim isn't a requirement or just a bit lower?

Some places don't start serving their heavier foods till 10:30-11am...I still recommend you get here as early as possible to avoid the lines. I got to the terminal at 8:30am and was able to grab some food, eat at a table with no wait, digest, and repeat once the the other places started serving. \n-Crowd starts coming in around by 11am, making the table seating limited.\n-Come with a friend(s)!!

We would ask on arrival if that was ok and I don't recall ever not being welcomed. And we would sometimes return, even more than once, especially if we had been treated well, as a larger group for a full meal. A restaurant should try to make its customers happy. That should be it's goal.  Long-standing restaurants will tell you this. This restaurant is the new kid in town. They should be trying to ingratiate themselves with the local community. They have a lot of well-established competition nearby. Their main goal shouldn't be, especially at this early stage, and really ever, squeezing dollars out of their customers. \n\nThis policy is, I suspect, created out of weakness. Restaurants with good reputations fill their reservations early. They should be trying to please people to the point that they join that category.  Then they would find that their reservations were taken up early, and that someone trying to abuse them would have to go elsewhere. Instead they are just being greedy before they have the right to be.\n\nDon't go to this restaurant. They need to fail. Cancel if you have a pending reservation.

They had our table ready for us when we arrived as we had a reservation. They had so many good specials and I wanted to try them all. I ordered the assorted fish Fra Diavolo. I've ordered this dish at about every Italian restaurant in the area and this is my favorite Fra Diavolo based on the amount and assortment of fish. At most other places, including one offender in the Italian market, they give you a huge pile of pasta with just a few mussels and clams. Here they give you a nice assortment of fish and a generous portion. Seriously there was as much seafood as there was pasta on my plate. I've also ordered the mussel appetizer to go before and it was very good. I usually am not a huge fan of shrimp scampi but my boyfriend ordered it and it was very good. I tried my friend's gnocchi and it was awesome. I love their menu and love that they give you the option of ordering either a smaller gnocchi for $15 or larger one for about $24. And you can do 1/2 of one kind of gnocchi and half with another kind of gnocchi. And they make everything made to order so they will even do substitutes if you request. Our waiter literally said, ""If we have the ingredient in our kitchen, we will be happy to make it for you."" \n\nEven if you aren't in the mood for gnocchi, serious order yourself a small plate of it and you won't be disappointed. \n\nWe also brought our own assortment of wine, beer and vodka.

(Looks around Nervously) Now before anyone comes for my head, 2 disclosures; this review has nothing to do with price. I honestly don't remember what I had to pay. I would feel the same way if the steak cost 20 dollars or 100 dollars. Second, I am in no way a chef or cook or claim to be, but what I have done is try multiple steakhouses and unfortunately the steak at steak 48 does not even begin to compare to some of the great steaksI have had in the past. I definitely run the risk of making this overly lengthy because of how much I have to say so I will try to make this as terse as possible.\n\nNow, this is my second time trying this restaurant as I felt my first time must have been bad day for the chef, both times I ordered the same thing; The Bone in Ribeye, and both times I was equally as disappointed. The steak, I don't know..., just confused me. I honestly did not understand what I was eating,  any donut who enjoys steaks will attest, the main component adding to a great steak's appeal it is the hard sear on the outside and the medium rare center. If you cook your steak right, and leave it to rest enough you should achieve this perfect sear and have a warm center, creating a contrast in the texture; the hard outer sear, and a tender center. \n\nThis ribeye had neither, though it was cooked to a perfect medium rare (visually), there was no sear on the outside  and the inside was oddly singeing hot, which still does not make any sense to me. I Imagine the steak was broiled in some form after it was cooked which will explain why the plate was scalding also, but this made for a really peculiar eating experience I truly truly did not care for. The steak was burning hot but still medium rare, it truly felt like someone chucked the steak into a microwave after it was cooked. The resulting offering was a flabby steak, red in the center but inedible because of how hot it was and the un-rendered fat.\n\nAll that aside, the appetizers and sides were, okay, I guess, but this is a steakhouse so who cares how good the appetizers are. My two stars are honestly for the service, despite the strict dress code and  spending minimum, this place is not pretentious or snobby at all, the staff are inviting and very welcoming, too bad the meal was not just as up to par.",7,Eok_ZJ-EbO10mIB27NS1Rw

The baristas were listening to a podcast (cool--I get it--you're the one who's gotta work on ur feet all day so you absolutely should listen to whatever you want) but when I tried to talk to them about how I liked the podcast they rolled their eyes and ignored me. And then when I got to the counter it took another minute or so for them to acknowledge me (again, I was the only person there and both baristas were just standing leaning against the counter listening to the podcast). \nAgain, I understand that it's hard work. You don't always have to smile. You don't always have to engage me in conversation. You can even be kinda pissed if I order something overly complicated because I understand what it's like. You can be sassy when someone's being an idiot. But when I start to feel like somehow I'm an inconvenience to you and am ruining your day *every* time I come in, it actually hurts! It makes me feel bad and sad! \n\nI'm going to continue coming to B2 when I'm in the area because the coffee and food and ambience is decent, and I love the little tip jar competitions they have (hey everyone, tip your baristas even if you think they're being rude.

We were one of only two tables but Hey they're supposed to be open till 10pm. Not a very warm, hospitable start to our Inaugural visit to King of Tandoor. \n\nWe started with the samosas, one of lamb and one vegetarian. Although we actually ordered a full order of each I'm glad the waiter spoke little English cause they would suffice.\nFresh and flaky. Good flavor. The accompanying sauces are excellent. One is quite spicy and tomato-like. Another was a smoky tamarind kind. The third was a green, chili-type sauce with very good flavor. \n\nHere comes Johhny or our entrees that is. Super fast delivery. Good thing place was empty :)\nSide not before I forget. A couple came into restaurant at 9:48pm and were told they were closed.  The guy was pissed, mumbling ""it's only quarter of!""  Hope he's not a Yelper lol\nI understand the kitchen/restaurant wants to close ""on time"" for a slow, rainy Wednesday and the couple coulda used a little better judgement but in my book you welcome them like it were 7pm!  To me it's bad business and gotta lose a star for it.\n\nOnto to entrees.  We each ordered a Tikka Masala, chicken for the lady and lamb for me.  Both had very good flavor but both the lamb and chicken were dry.  The accompanying rice was good.\n\nWe chose the regular naan and the garlic naan.  Garlic naan was much better but I'd say the naan was above average but nothing spectacular.\n\nI dare not even ask about the rice pudding nor was any hint of dessert even offered as 10PM approached.  9:57pm to be exact.\n\nOne note worth mentioning.  Besides the waiter who took our order, we were also servicing by a gentleman who resembled 'tattoo"" from Fantasy Island.  ""The plane, the plane!!!""  It was funny to remember the show although this guy was of normal stature, he looked so much like him.  He was super friendly and had an infectious smile.  He was very helpful and attentive.  Practically the highlight of our visit.\n\nIn summary, while I was satisfied with my meal and service I don't think I'll be making it a point to return.  It is close to my current digs but there are so many other Indian restaurants I like but I'd certainly wouldn't avoid King of Tandoor if the timing were right.",1,T6TInNEhz-qm5tT_ZjQEoA

Whether you're shopping for food or looking for a meal this is the spot. It's a total mix of cultures from South Philly guys selling cheesesteaks, to the Asian seafood market, to the Southern Soul Food, to the Amish vendors, and everything in between. The oldest business in the market (and one of the oldest in all of Philly) is Bassett's Ice Cream (in Philly since 1861) they make some of the creamiest ice cream around. Two of my favorite treats here are the Amish pretzels at Miller's Twists and the Apple Dumplings at Dutch Eating Place (just to name a couple). The Terminal Market is a huge clean place and there's always a seat or two to sit and relax or eat, one seating area even has a piano player playing throughout the day. If food isn't your thing there are also a couple shops selling spices, wines, and gifts. If I had to narrow it down I would have to say Reading Terminal is one of the top 3 things to do while in Philly (next to the Art Museum and Eastern State Penn).",4,M1cMsRL4L7IUr9RILDywEQ

We thought FINALLY an authentic middle eastern restaurant in Philadelphia that we can eat authentic food that tastes like back home and not have to travel two hours for it. Even the name sounds exciting sofra which means feast in Arabic- we couldn't wait to get there!\n\nThe place is beautifully decorated with middle eastern artwork on the wall. We were a little disappointed when we walked in and were told we need to order & pay first so we looked at the menu and even more disappointed to find everything was just fast food- shawarma, falafel, hummus. My friends and I were trying to make the best of it and we had saved our appetites for this place so we proceeded to order. My friends ordered the shawarma sandwich and I attempted to order falafel but the manager told me the person who does them was not there at the moment instead I ordered fateet hummus without meat and we ordered 2 orders of halloumi cheese to share. \nMy friends said their shawarma was ok. The halloumi cheese came out- I wish I took a picture of it. It was two tiny pieces of cheese that didn't look like they were actually fried instead just browned with an airlighter. The salt on it was so robust I wish I didn't take a bite out of it. \nThen the fattet hummus comes- idk where they got the recipe for this but that was not fattet hummus. It was served cold, without garbanzo beans, no yogurt. Basically just the hummus and pine nuts. \nI assume the owner is not middle eastern because the people in the back who were cooking came out and did not look like they were. Unless the owner was just not in the restaurant when we were there which is a shame since the place just opened & it is the prime time when the owners should be there making sure everything goes right & hires the correct people for the job. At one point two people stepped out of the kitchen and reeked of weed that's when we decided to just get up and leave. \n\nThe two stars  are for the decor not the food! Unfortunately I won't be going back!",8,td59mx4jPGvSrTChGgvFlw

The best time to visit is during the week, as it's less crowded and you have more of a chance of getting a table. Some of my favorite counters are Old City Coffee, Beilers donuts, and Four Seasons juice bar. If you park in any of the garages that offer discounted parking near by, bring your ticket in to be validated for a parking discount.  \n\nThe only downside is that it gets so crowded on the weekends you can barely move around and it closes at 6 pm. Also, many of the Amish counters are not open on Sunday.",0,1_sws6Q8TiR21CzzNvxUiw

Despite the fact that this was my error, the staff still took the very kind step to refund my order in full.

Personally, I felt like I was in an amusement park and was belted into a ride with a lot of noise and lights. (Note: this spot is NOT noisy---the noise level is excellent--but the dazzle is a little overwhelming--Las Vegas meets HGTV.)  The design is overdone--you are surrounded by so much ""design"" and soooo much black and white it's almost paralyzing and certainly distracting not to mention the very 90's open kitchen. For $104 for a large filet I don't really want to watch them cook it.  Staff is a bit robotic but there for you.  Food was a mix of excellent and so-so but VERY expensive.  A lot has gone into this spot--perhaps too much. The strip steak was outstanding, the meat loaf mushy.  Maybe a half star as a pandemic allowance and a half for newness.  Here's hoping for consistent excellence as Steak48 settles in.\n\nPS. The complimentary dessert (cake+ice cream+ caramel) was amazing!",4,ekADJznbRMpM17KdluKX8g

Crowded and bustling but everywhere you look there is something new to see and you are assaulted by mouth watering smells and temptations every few paces. It makes the volume of people jostling you entirely bearable.\n\nMy fave samplings:\nTermini Brothers for tasty cheese cannoli, fig bars, sfogliatelle, pignoli cookies and biscotti.\nFisher's for Amish pretzels with butter\nLancaster Co Dairy for fresh squeezed lemonade\nSalumeria for gourmet meats and cheese which made for an awesome midnight snack\nDutch Eating Place for food that is similar to Grandma's and a kick ass apple dumpling.\n\nIf I lived in Philly I would be in here all the time, the shopping looked incredible, super fresh products of all sorts. So sad to miss DiNic's though, I will have to return at some point. Thanks to Bobby P, Andrew T and Mira V for the suggestion.",12,o0g89bEnHnmwPXQu9QJ6eg
