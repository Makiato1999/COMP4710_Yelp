Pros: Broccoli and green beans are good and always on the menu.  Get your veggies people, thin noodles - mai fun, and chicken broccoli.  They always have FRESH fruit.  I go there to eat a decent meal and they deliver.
Cons: It's a buffet. The food can sit for a while and get old and the variety over time is not the best.

We were sat almost instantly and greeted kindly by one of the managers.  Our server was also very friendly and efficient.  In all fairness, it wasn't overly busy, but still there were other customers around.  The menu was great and the food was as well.  The calamari appetizer was wonderful.  My ribeye steak was cooked perfectly to temp.  Salad was very nice as well.  Hubby's seafood platter was pretty nice but he said the fish-n-chips (fish) portion had a different taste, coming off as a little strange to him from what was expected.  Mostly he enjoyed the meal though and was not complaining...only answered me when asked.   The cocktail sauce here is quite tasty as well.

It came highly recommended by a few of them.  There was a decent sized group of us, but we were seated right away.

We started with the Flash Fried Brussel Sprouts. These were SO GOOD!!  Everyone at the table enjoyed them.  For my meal, I ordered the Block Burger with no bun, and was able to add a half salad instead of the fries. There's an upcharge of $3 to do this, but the salad is large! And it's only the half sized version! You chose between the Block salad or the Beet and Apple salad. I chose the Block which is almost like a Cobb salad. It was so fresh and tasty!

Pros: Birra Morretti on tap, sexy menu, chic decor, good service, octopus appetizer, squid ink pasta

Cons: Carpaccio is one of my favorite foods and this was not very good at all (no crostini, horseradish or arugula for one thing...and I don't know where the ""Italian kimchi"" was but of that is a play on words regarding the roasted capers then I'm not sure I follow their line of thinking -- kimchi is fermented cabbage after all), sticks on sticks on sticks of butter is used in preparation of the Carbonara which totally drowned out the taste of the guanciale and I didn't see the value at all in adding corn to the dish, Brussels sprouts are just okay but what's worse is that you smell like them for 2 days (I didn't even eat them the second time around and I still smell them today!), mushroom/fontina/truffle pizza and the Quattro formaggi/pancetta were too rich for my blood. This seemed to be the theme: too much burro.

Each noodle dish had their own flare, but had the commonality of soft, supple noodles evenly coated in their own vibrant sauce. They were very much stick to your ribs asian soul food. As dessert we had the thai tea, banana boba, and the taro boba, which were the cherry on top and great finish to the meal. The tapioca balls were cooked just right, and we all agreed that the taro one was the best from the rest. Also, to make the experience even more worth the visit was the look of the place itself.

This review is mostly to recognize the efforts of our server and (especially) one of the managers - bearded chap, John?? - who took great care of my wife, who has numerous food sensitivities. They answered her questions patiently, and at one point, John (as we shall call him) came out to discuss in detail the ingredients of the salad dressing. Collaboratively, a good solution was found - and my wife enjoyed her meal very much. 

I have one primary suggestion for improvement: turn the music down. At least for the Sunday lunch crowd, the music seemed far louder than most customers likely wanted. 

We will definitely return next time we're in Tucson.",0,8W-6rUSG1FmQdfZbUhkAfg

Even though it's a small restaurant, I liked how I didn't feel cramped or that it was too noisy and busy.

The menu has a great variety of meats and I found it difficult to choose from the pulled pork sandwich, or 1/2 rack ribs.  I decided on the ribs that comes with cornbread (yum!), choice of 2 beans, and choice of 3 potatoes.  Other friends shared the platter for $60, chicken and waffles, and beef brisket sandwich.

Our food came out fairly quickly or maybe I didn't notice the time due to chatter around the table.  My plate had lots of food and big rack of ribs.  I picked the less spicy of the beans and found there was a little spice to them and they were great with pulled pork mixed in.  They provided a big scoop of mashed potatoes and the piece of cornbread was delicious too.  I tried the beef brisket and found the meat to be too chewy and little fat for my liking.  The coleslaw was good.  I had one rib and took the rest with my potatoes home for the next day's dinner.

The 4 friends who shared the beef brisket and ribs platter couldn't finish their meal (they also ordered a Greek salad to balance all the meat!) which came with fries and cornbread.

When I saw the ""carmelized (sic) banana nut pancakes, I knew I had to order them. They turned out to be even better than I hoped!

There were two pancakes, each as big as the plate, filled with wonderful, brown, gooey bananas with a light crisp on the outside. Oh, so good!

I'll definitely be back, but maybe next time I'll come for kimchi cheesesteak at lunch!

After breakfast, I bought some kimchi to take home and Misha gave me recommendations for how to make kimchi steamed fish with it. Now that's great service!

Highly recommended. But go early because there is only seating for 20 and it fills up fast.",2,AiIISHAAp5I1PF5fClkmMw

I lost my car key at work last night but didn't panic just had my spare dropped off. Not only does the unlock button not work (all the other buttons work)but it can't be fixed now the only way for me to get a key is to pay $235 for another key and programming but since I can't get in the car is have to pay a locksmith just to get inside. The thing that infuriates me the most is their unwillingness to help or show any compassion when they obviously had to know the key was useless and still passed it off as if it was okay.

-Great Service 
- Terrific Food
- Loved!
I seriously don't know where to begin.  This wonderful John Besh creation is purely delightful.  

The location is only a few blocks from Canal Street but seems like miles from the tourist feel of the Quarter tourist restaurants.  

Upon entering we were greeted promptly and warmly.  We had reservations and in just a few minutes she walked us back to our table almost in back (which was really great)

The tables are fairly close together so chances are very good you will hear your neighbors' conversation so be warned.  The overall feel reminds me of something from time past; the restaurant is in a beautiful old building with many unique details on the walls and I love, love, love the bar in the middle of the room.  The whole feel was very lively and energetic yet in our little table from afar still relaxed.

Onto the food.... I had built Chef Besh up so high in my mind I honestly thought he couldn't live up to it. Too unrealistic.  He did live up to my expectations and surpassed my dreams for a perfect dinner.

Appetizer - Baked Oysters - sublime

Appetizer 2 - Crab bisque - made many other crab bisque I have had pale in comparison (more soupy than bisque-y by the way)

Appetizer 3 - (hey we were sharing!) Cold Shrimp- these were very good quality.  Only odd thing was I had to ask for horseradish / only served with ketchup.  A note on the horseradish.  If you like horseradish - order some on the side here just to try.  I don't know why or how but it is the best horseradish you will ever try and the most potent.  I wish I could get my hands on it to keep at my house. 

Entrée 1 - Hamburger.  Just so wow you can't imagine how good until you taste it.  The meat is probably the tastiest hamburger meat I have ever had and I have had some pretty great burgers.

Entree 2 - Blue Crab Cavatelli - pasta with red sauce with blue crab.  Just perfect.

Dessert - are you kidding?  After 3 appetizers and tasting a little of 2 Entrees dessert wasn't even a consideration.

Bottom line: Go, go, go, go, go, go!  (but make a reservation)",0,x1nD7Un3hLdiyemkvxVOAQ

Something has gone terribly wrong since then! To start, we were sat in a booth with big holes on the leather seat. When asked to move, we were told that it know turns into Hookah lounge around 10pm with a DJ and that was probably the result of that . This was not what we found 2 years ago. Our waitress brought over a bread basket while we waited for our food. We were starved so we munched on the bread until our food came. It had to be the worse bread we were EVER served. It was hard and stale. We asked for another basket. The second came out warm and stale.
I am a pizza lover, so was excited to try the brick oven pizza that I remember raving about in the past. The oven that I remember burning brightly, was dim and shut down. We were told that they are working on getting a piece for it and they are now making the pizza's upstairs..so we went ahead and ordered 2 pizza and a few other dishes. As the dishes came out 1 by 1, the night proceeded to decline quickly. We got the beets salad and the mussels which were both ok. The cheese and meats board was the farthest from cured meats!! The braised short rib ravioli sounded so good that we couldn't wait to try. When we dug in, we were disappointed to find jarred sauce that clearly spelled preservatives!! Finally on to the anticipated pizza. We each picked up a slice but again to our dismay, it was a lifeless, jarred sauce, uncooked disaster. We called over our waitress that could have not been nicer and apologetic. We asked to speak to the manager. This was probably the worse part of the night if you can imagine. Very kindly we discussed all of our problem from the bread to the ravioli, to the oven, to the pizza. We told him that we were here before and not sure if management changed but maybe consider sticking to the dance party that was supposed to happen instead of advertising it as a restaurant. He picked up the bread and said ""yep it's hard"". He did not reply when asked what kind of sauce that was being used on the ravioli. And we picked up the lifeless pizza. We told him we were not paying for the following items. He just said ""ok"". Never an apology or anything! That is the basic fundamental of customer service. Needless to say, we will never return and will be surprised if the ""restaurant portion of this establishment will be around next year for someone else's bad review....",0,JoYaFsNp7atnYOwABYPYMQ

We popped into Tria after putting our name in for a table at Mercato down the street and told there'd be an hour wait.  I was secretly hoping this was the case because I wanted to come to Tria for drinks.  

When we walked in, my husband was carrying a 6 pack of beer that we had planned to bring to the restaurant.  He asked if it was OK that we brought it in, not wanting to be rude.  Not only did they give us the OK, but they graciously offered to put our beer in their refrigerator until we left.  We were so shocked at just how nice and accomodating the staff was, which in retrospect seems silly.

We stood at the bar, but were quickly alerted by the bartender to a couple of free stools at the opposite end after we ordered our beers.  I ordered the Allagash White, which is not the most brave choice, but it was my first time having it and it was delicious.  I cannot for the life of me remember what beer my husband ordered, but I know he really enjoyed it.  Mary, our bartender, was very helpful in offering her tips and suggestions.  For our second round, my husband decided to try the mead they offered because he'd never had it. He didn't care for it all that much, but I think that's more due to his own over-hyped expectations:)  I had a glass of Prosecco which was exactly what I expected, delicious.  For my husband's last drink, he had a pint of the Southern Tier Pumking, which was on special for $3/pint.  We had previously had it by the bottle and didn't much care for it.  It was FAR superior on draft.  I admit that I had more than my share of his beer.

Overall the beer choices were fun and the staff was SO nice and accomodating.  We don't get down into the city much, but we will definitely make sure to return to Tria.",0,n5jbfcZt1N7SR-nSbt24gA

Their menu was pretty varied as well as their noodle selection.  You could order any noodle dish on the menu and pick the type of noodle you desired (for those noodle nerds out there).  I've eaten here on many occasions because it is one of the last places in town to get great dim sum.  
Additionally, once you look past the american chinese selections (ie, sweet and sour pork, mongolian beef) their authentic selections are mouth watering!

Their service?  Well my water was never empty and we had a short wait for the food to arrive!

The wait was significantly longer than we were initially told, but they text you when your table is ready, so you can go next door to the Mercer and have a drink while you wait. They'll also serve you snacks and drinks at Rostizado while you wait, if you like. We ended up sitting at the window bar, which wasn't ideal with three of us, but everything else more than made up for it. 

First off, the food is amazing. The queso fundido was fantastic, and my dad loved the tamales. We got the platter for two (which is huge - even with three of us, I had enough leftovers for two lunches), which is amazing. I often hear people rave about the chicken, but the pork is absolutely perfect and was maybe my favourite of the two, but just by a hair. We also ordered veggies, but forgot to ask what the ""seasonal"" vegetable was, and it was kale, which I hate ... but it was actually good! I'm probably still not going to go out and eat a bunch of kale, but I had no idea it could be made remotely tasty. The margaritas were also amazing - I love that they only salt one side of the glass so that you can decide whether you want the salt or not. 

Our server, Kathryn, was sweet, funny, attentive and just an absolute joy. I was so impressed with her I left a note with the management telling them how awesome she was (and tipped generously, of course). We asked her advice on dessert, and she steered us towards the one I probably wouldn't have ordered - and am I ever glad she did. It was a Mexican ""cheesecake,"" which is nothing like the American version, but still rich, creamy and with just a hint of sweetness. It's a perfect dessert for people who don't like a lot of sugar, and I wanted to lick the plate after we were done.

One thing to keep in mind is that you may not get your own table - like Corso 32 and Tres Carnales, Rostizado has a couple of those long tables where they can seat either large groups or multiple smaller groups, so be prepared to get cozy with your neighbours.",3,CrebLMoe1C9VLDgXkYoABg

When I walk into an Indian (or any type of predominantly ethnic) restaurant and see mostly gringos, it makes me raise my eyebrows. I will say that nothing was particularly offensive about the food and I've had far worse North Indian fare in restaurants, hence the three star rating. However, my meal wasn't something that would keep me coming back. The spicing and seasoning of the various curries is surprisingly vibrant, but these sauces feel quite heavy. The meats here aren't the best, as my lamb was overcooked and a bit tough. The vegetables in the Jalfrezi were the frozen, supermarket variety, which was not enjoyable at all. Naans are average, rice is prepared well. Everything is overpriced.

The food earns 2 stars, but the service was friendly enough to warrant another. Desi Village's food is simply average, and fairly costly for the quality. I won't be returning any time soon unless I'm magically stranded in KOP with few other options.",0,Yft76ogF5YzCQ4mn6vSQ6Q

We heard many good reviews from friends.  I called to schedule an appointment, and the lady was really friendly on the phone.  I told her that our last vet didn't really seem comfortable handling our pup - he's an 80lb. Am. Staffy/Neopolitan Mastiff mix, and I had explained the couple of experiences we had.  She told me not to worry, many of the girls that work there have pitties and other bully breed pups, so that made me feel a lot better.

She offered to put us in for an early appointment so there wouldn't be too many other dogs in the waiting room since our guy gets really excitable.  No one ever suggested that before, and I really appreciated it.  It makes for a less stressful situation for everyone.  

We took him to his appointment, and when we arrived, everyone LOVED him, and he loved them right back!  I wanted to cry because I was so happy we found a veterinarian who understood our dog and knew how to take care of him.  I'm pretty sure he fell in love with his doctor.  He didn't want to leave her side, and that has NEVER happened with anyone else before.  It was like night and day compared to the previous vet's office.

Overall, if you have a pup who gets excitable or may not get a long with other dogs, or if the get anxious or scared, this vet will go the extra mile to make sure they help and make your visit very easy.

Oh, and they're prices are extremely reasonable, based on what I have paid to the other vet.  Our bill was basically half of what we used to pay.

I would definitely recommend them to a friend!",5,gXxGC2VuMryPK3JxsrVIBg

It's like they tried to pack in as many tables as they possibly could. We were lucky that we got there early, because I couldn't imagine trying to navigate my way through there with a tray full of food once it was super packed. We were CONSTANTLY being bumped by people.

My last complaint was that my salad cost $14!!!!! Now don't get me wrong, it was huge... But $14?!?! I mean it was good, but I don't think it was $14 good.

It's a bit out of the way for us, but it's conveniently located after a trip to nearby Costco. Located in a long strip mall along busy Manchester road, it's easy to miss this place. We really wanted to try Ramen Tei (their adjoining sister restaurant) but I couldn't get them on the phone for a reservation so I made a reservation to Nippon Tei at opentable. 
We arrived at our reservation time, 6pm on a Saturday evening and the restaurant was half filled already, with servers zipping around busily. I would recommend a reservation as many open tables at that time were for reservations and there was a upset couple that walked in and could not be seated at the tables. 
We were told that you cannot order food from Ramen Tei while seated in Nippon Tei (previously you can). So we went with plan b, we ordered 3 rolls and we reserved a table at Ramen Tei to have a dinner ""progressive""! We got 2 regular rolls and I got their signature Golden Dragon Roll, which had lobster inside, topped with salmon, tobiko and tad too much of spicy mayo. I do commend them on the use of Yuzu, which gave a fun and citrus-umami flavor to the roll. I did notice that for the same price, another sushi place in the central west end had twice the amount of lobster in the rolls.  The rolls were good, but on par with several other sushi restaurants in St. Louis. The prices were average for around STL. The service was good and the food came out quickly. 
Overall the food was above average, the prices comparable to other restaurants in STL. For us, it wouldn't be worth a half an hour drive if we weren't already in the area.

The decor is nothing to write home about, but they have nice music.

Lentil soup was decent. Ive had better in the UAE and Michigan.

The Mixed grill was great, lots of food. Pita and hummus, Tomato/Onion Salad, 2-or 3 kabobs That was the highlight of the meal.
They  have the great Toum, white garlic sauce which was very yummy!

My 2 main problems that kept it from getting a 4 stars are:

1) The server while nice seemed to only check on me sporadically. Im pretty low maintenance on service,(just bring the correct food, hot and dont mess up the bill)Even after I finished , it took something like 25 min to get the bill. I waved my hands frantically in the air, but it seemed for naught.

2) The white sauce is good,,but its kind of a low blow to charge 75 cents for a tiny smidge of it DURING the meal. In my favorite Michigan restaurant, La Marsa, pita and garlic sauce are complimentary during your meal. Only if you order it to go is there a charge. If the sauce was made of Uranium-238 or Monica Bellucci's toenails , I could understand.
Its just garlic, olive oil, and spices lol.

A lot of bigger groups here, which is definitely recommended. BYO, so you can come with a group of 6+ and enjoy a variety of dishes and hang out for a while. 

Service - 3 Stars: Their service isn't great. I think some of the wait staff actually don't even speak any English, or they just pretend they don't. 

Food - 5 Stars: I want to start this off by saying, if you don't like spicy, don't come here. You won't get the full Han experience unless you're able to enjoy a decent volume of heat on your food. The ""Chef's Specialties"" menu is the one to order off of, and has a rating scale for spiciness. The ""hottest"" dish on the menu is the Dry Pot style, which I think is actually quite manageable. I do eat Habanero peppers raw, however. The appetizers are quite spicy as well, but it will help your palette adjust by the time your main course comes out. 

Their food is hands down THE BEST Szechuan/Chinese I have ever had. I have tried around 20+ dishes here, and have not disliked a single one. Dan Dan Mien is the best around, nothing compares to Han's Dan Dan. Pork belly appetizers and main dishes are delicious. Cucumber appetizer is also really good. I would recommend going with around 6 people, and each should order their own ""dinner"" - then share it among everyone. You need to try as much as you can when you're here. 

Dry Pot style Lamb is the my absolute favorite dish on the menu. It's the spiciest as well. It is served to your table in a small Wok on top of a chemical burner to keep it hot. 

Plating - N/A: There's really no plating. Everything is served family style. 

This place is 5 Stars because of the food. Forget about everything else - and just enjoy what is probably the most authentic and delicious Szechuan cuisine in the US. Recently moved to NYC area, and definitely looking forward to trying their newest location in the city.",0,r3vZkJnKYffZHYoNczlulg

My husband and I sat at the bar on Wednesday night.  The restaurant was pretty full for a Wednesday, so I think everyone is excited about this one.  It is a Del Pietro restaurant and Del Pietro himself was there cooking away.  It is very cool and simply decorated on the inside.  They also have some sidewalk tables outside.  

On to the beer.  They have a nice selection of local beers, but they just don't make since.  When talking to the bartender, they are still trying to figure the beer selection out and he was VERY open to our suggestions.  It was weird that they had one AB product on draft, Amberbock...Um why any??  So, that will eventually go away...They also have 3 IPAs on draft and that will change as well.  We were very happy to see Urban Chestnut's Zwickel on draft and suggested Winged Nut as well.  Great bartender, very friendly and eager to be at this new spot.

We ordered the bacon spread with the grilled bread to start.  WOW.  It was so different and sweet + salty.  It tasted like it had a little maple syrup in it.  The bread is locally sourced and it was grilled to perfection.  I would definitely suggest that as an amazing starter.  We also ordered the Block salad to share and the Pork Chop to share.  The salad was good, very fresh, and I substituted the dressing for the citrus vinagrette.  The Pork Chop was SPOT ON.  It was grilled and seasoned to a tee.  It came with some small roasted potatoes and a crisp, light slaw of sorts.  I would highly recommend the chop.

I have a 1974 Fiat Spider 124 convertible which runs great due to Emilio's efforts.  As the years have gone by, I have found it harder and harder to find trustworthy mechanics who are willing to work on classic Fiats, especially since some parts can be a bit of a treasure hunt.

I recently had my car towed to the shop (I live about an hour away) for repairs, because the starter had completely died.  While the car was there, I also asked him to fix a number of things that needed attention, including some fiddly trim-related issues, and an adjustment to my convertible top, 

I got the car back in fantastic shape!  It's running great, and I'm  delighted to have it once again in drivable condition as it had been sitting for quite some time.  Emilio was great with his communication, his prices were reasonable considering the amount of work I kept tossing at him, and he was nice when I repeatedly called him back to ask him to work on yet another nit I'd forgotten to mention when I had the car brought in.

From the outside, the hotel looks very quaint, but inside of the rooms there are all of the modern amenities you want and need. It's also a quick walk to popular destinations for tourists: Jackson Square, Bourbon Street, the French Market, etc.  

We stayed in Room 113 which was right outside of the cutest courtyard, which had plenty of chairs and tables to relax in. 

There are a few minor downfalls of this hotel though. For instance, because of the way the hotel is laid out, noise travels very easily throughout the courtyard. I was woken up a few times because of how loud it was. Also when I was trying to check out, I asked someone at the front desk if they could hold on to my bags for a few hours because check out was at noon and I had a few hours to kill before my flight and didn't want to carry all of my luggage around. Even though I was told earlier that this a service that is offered, another person who worked there kept giving me an attitude and asking whether I had a car in the lot I could put my luggage into. We did have a rental car, but I didn't feel as safe having my valuables in the car. It was annoying that they were giving me a hard time about holding my luggage, even though this was apparently a service they provide. Also, I'm not sure what was worse: the shitty free WiFi or the shitty free coffee in the lobby. Okay, end rant.

Mark Muffler is always professional, friendly, and willing to work around your schedule. They have continuously done an excellent job with whatever I have brought my car in for. They even installed my new headlight units, though that is not necessarily what they do. They are fair in price and my final bill has often been less than their original estimate.

My car is a 2001 Nissan and it runs like a top thanks to them! 
 As an example: I just recently took my car in to have its brakes checked. They did another excellent job and they even tried to save me some money by not replacing the front rotors. They explained that the rotors COULD be replaced, but felt they still had some life left in them. They also stated to me that if I wasn't comfortable with that, they would do whatever I asked them to do. My brakes have been working just fine and I can't tell you how nice it is to have such honest people working on my car.

In their profession they truly understand that it's not about the initial money they take in- it's about honesty, quality, and the customer. That's why my father and I keep returning.

Unfortunately the travel agent who handles weddings was not in the office that day, but another travel agent  sat with me to get some details (where, when, # of guests, etc.), to then provide to her colleague. The woman I sat with, I don't recall her name, but she was very nice and provided me with a book to take home outlining the hotels in the Caribbean with which AAA has associations/partnerships with. I ended my visit with being told I would be hearing from the wedding travel agent when she was back in the office the next day. It's now been over two weeks, and I've not heard anything from AAA. 

I'm annoyed at the poor customer service at this location, but it will not deter me from going to another AAA location for wedding info. Giving two stars for the one woman who tried helping me, and was very professional & nice. Also for their convenience of being in Center City, so I was able to run over on my lunch break.

Just off highway 154 and down a windy road you'll first notice (if on a weekend lunch) the rows or cars a motorcycles lining the 2 lane road well before you get there. Nestled in the trees, on a creek and in the shade,  Cold Spring Tavern is refreshingly cool and even something down right cold. Dress accordingly as it's always cooler than you would expect. In the winters, large fireplaces in each room of the old buildings help keep things toasty. There many reasons why to come but I'll start with the first meal of the day.

Breakfast I observed as the quietest time to visit. Although it may get busy, it's not noticeable. The tavern next door to the dining room is not open and that helps keep the crowds down. The menu is standard fare with the country fried steak and huevos rancheros worth mentioning. 

While there are good lunch items on the menu including the buffalo burger and a myriad of home made chili, the real draw is Sundays outside and tri-tip sandwiches on a hoagie. The line is long and forms at the bar for the best meat around. While you're enjoying lunch, live music is playing and people watching is at a high. This is the best meal of the day.

Dinner 'aint cheep but it's well worth it. Meat is on the menu and with wild game a plenty, vegetarians may become ravenous and devour the rabbit, venison or duck. It's a simple menu offering good, solid food. Nothing fancy here folks.

Having lived in the area for over 3 years now, I've made many trips to Cold Springs Tavern and it's always a stock for our friends who come into town. This place is not like anything else around and that's what makes it special. Now I'm hungry.

We made our reservation through a TravelZoo offer, so then we were worried we were going to be treated differently than guests who made the reservation through the hotel- not true at all! 
The hotel was perfect, from letting us check in a little early to the cucumber-mint water in the lobby (I only wish it was out 24/7!) to the rafts at the pool to the staff. The room is nothing special, but it has a comfortable bed and a mini fridge. I will be honest I read somewhere about the hotel having a tub and I was like does that mean there is not a shower (haha) don't worry there is a tub/shower!
We were on the 5th floor (looking over the pool/courtyard) and could not hear any Bourbon Street or construction noise. The hotel is located walking distance from everywhere we wanted to go and it has great Jazz music (no cover--just buy a drink) in their own Jazz club. 
I would recommend this hotel to anyone going to New Orleans!",0,nU9AoURgIw-vadMoi7g5jw

I do think if you are going to be a waitress at this establishment, at least OWN IT.  Act like you want to be there, dressed like that and have some personality to go with the body.  I only say this as all these girls seem like they are almost embarressed to be working there, they don't make eye contact to anyone (even me or the guys at my table) and are horrid at any customer service skills.

I know you are not going there to have great service, but I would rather go to Hooters and get a friendly and attractive girl serve me!!!

But too many drunken nights at Mad Dogs has resulted in my forgetting to actually attempt writing this review. Until I read one of my fellow Yelp buddy, Terri H's, Pink's Hot Dog review and suddenly started thinking hot dogs (and subsequently drooling all over my work laptop).

What do I love about Mad Dogs? The owners ROCK!!!! Eric and Kristen are the kindest ever, running a laidback staff and both work really hard every night to service huge lines of drunk people. My first foray into their establishment was in the middle of the week when my best friend and I decided to play hooky from school and go grab a couple of margaritas on the pier. Except we stopped short when we saw the words ""chili dog"" and opted for a beer and ooey goodness instead. 

We discovered right off that the owner and his wife had the same name's as my best friend and her older brother = immediate bond. He served us two beers on the house, hand delivered our food and from there spent a good half hour chatting with us about how he got started with the idea to open the place.

The dogs are delicious - I know because the first time I had them, I wasn't drunk! Especially when covered in Hormel chili and spicy nacho cheese and sprinkled with real cheddar cheese! The giant pickles and churros are also the perfect touch - especially in Santa Barbara where good ol theme park/carnival food is hard to come by. The sausage options also proved to be tasty over time.

Everytime we booze in SB, we hit up Mad Dog's. Halloween was the best night, showing up in our Chicago Catherine Zeta Jones and Renee Zelleweger costumes after a night of karaoke to do a small skit for free dogs! My love for this place goes beyond managing to skip the entire line and have fabulous VIP service even in the midst of the biggest 2am rush hour. It's personal and I hate to think of all the great nights I have missed since leaving SB almost two years ago at Mad Dogs.

I've been a member of City Fitness since March of 2012.  I was so excited for it to become a part of the neighborhood; Sweat did not appeal to me and I could not afford the pricetag of the Bellevue at that time.  I was happy with the variety of the classes offered, the layout of the gym itself, and that the machinery was brand new.
Over two years later, my main reasons for staying a member is my trainer and City Fitness' proximity to my house.  

I've been working with my trainer, Jamel, since January of 2014.  He has changed the way I think about my personal fitness.  No stranger to the gym, I began working with him as prep for my wedding.  My wedding has come and gone, but not Jamel.  His type of motivation reminds me of my old track coaches (from my high school days) and I love it: positive, serious, and honest.  I have many girlfriends who have used trainers in the past, but many of them had issues with their trainer's schedule or their trainer period.  To date, I have experienced nothing but positivity and professionalism while working with Jamel.  He makes my workouts fun and is easy to get along with.  I would recommend him to any person, guy or girl, looking to take their fitness to the next level and aren't afraid to work hard.

The room where one works out with their trainer is pretty decent too.  While some equipment needs refreshing, overall it is a nice space.  Not having to share equipment with gym-goers who are half heartedly lifting a dumbbell is a welcome perk.

The front desk is a rotating cast of characters.  They run the gammet from competent and welcoming folks to braindead twits who can barely answer the phone and mouth a ""Hi!"" to incoming guests.  Phone calls to the gym can be answered by friendly and knowledgable staff or people who seem irritated you're calling to ask a question (that they don't know the answer to).  It's a crap shoot when it comes to the front desk.

The old sign-up system for classes of calling in to get on a class list was stinky, but the ""tech issues"" that ensued after the City Fitness App was created blew my mind.  It took much longer than one would imagine to fix the kinks.  I wondered why the members of the gym were being used as the tester audience, rather than running tests with staff BEFORE releasing the app.. But what do I know...

So basically, it appears the business end of this opperation could use some improvement.  The phrase ""Proper preparation prevents a piss-poor performance"" rings in my ears.

I'd recommend City Fitness to anyone in the Fitler Square or Grad Hospital area who are looking for a gym without a pool.",1,Q6dO6iwnxC-TbSv2PlEwoA

Now, that may be due to having never walked past it and NOTICED that there was a really ridiculously nice spa not 2 blocks away from my apartment. Then again, it is located on the second floor of The Medical Tower (Huh? What?), and apparently I'm not the only one to get confused over its location - good thing I double checked the location on their website before heading over for my appointment. 

I booked a full leg and bikini waxing barely a week ago; why it was so easy, I'm not sure - weekday mornings are probably slow times for them - but I arrived for my 10:15am appointment and was clearly the first client of the day. Daria was the aesthetician I saw, and she was fantastic. She gave me the choice of either wearing the paper ""underwear,"" my own underwear, or nothin' at all if I was comfortable with that, and I opted for the paper wisp of fabric. I did it once in Europe and survived, and that was with a BIG language barrier, so whatever, its better than getting wax on my underwear any day. Daria was very nice and friendly, we chatted throughout the session and I had a lovely time. She used the blue wax for my bikini region since she said it was more gentle, which was a nice change from what I've experienced before. Also, at the end she asked me to look and make sure she didn't miss any areas, something I definitely appreciated because I hate getting home only to find that one overlooked patch. 

The spa itself is lovely, very modern in design but with a laid back feeling to the space. There was soothing music in the background during my session, only loud enough to hear it in the back of your mind while you zone out or chat. The service I experienced was wonderful, everyone was nice and friendly. There is a dog at the spa, which I heard bark maybe twice while I was there, but that sort of thing really doesn't bother me. My quest may have just ended - I will probably be back here again when I require more of Daria's care.",4,x6erNzhuM_c7xW6PlqClIQ

My friend and I were visiting the Reno/Sparks area on some business and he suggested this location. He had stayed here in August and liked it because it was next to the little lake and it was close to a lot of nearby shops and restaurants.

We arrived Friday around 12:30pm and they let us check-in early, I like that. All of the staff I encountered were very friendly some were like almost over-the-top friendly but that's ok it's better than being unfriendly or ignoring us. Got our room and settled in with our luggage stuff.

First impression of the room was it was very clean. There were usb ports built into the night stand and desk/tv stand so that's very convenient. The bathroom had a modern sliding door that was kind of unique. The little shower soap/shampoo/conditioners were Neutrogena brand. I bring my own soap but I liked that they weren't some cheap low quality product

A couple minutes into it we noticed that neither of the trashcans were emptied from the previous stay and that the shower had a used bar of soap still sitting there. (Gross) 

Being that this was day 1 of a 4-day stay and we didn't want to start it off with complaining we shrugged it off and didn't mention it to anyone. 

Our 3rd day we went out of town and I confirmed that housekeeping would come in while we were gone, however when we got back that night the room had not been touched. So THAT time I had to go to the front desk. They were very professional, no excuses given--the operations manager introduced herself to me and said she would be right up to take care of it.

Another positive thing I noted is this hotel has good coffee, they have it in the lobby at all times and also in the breakfast area. To be fair I only tried the ""robust"" blend but I enjoyed it. (The room instant coffee was good too but I think I used too much water when I made it.) They also stock hot chocolate and 5+ different flavors of tea at the coffee bar in lobby and breakfast area.

The breakfast bar is the typical spread you will find at good hotels. Yogurts, fruit Cereal, hot oatmeal, pastries, bagels, toast, hard boiled eggs, waffle maker and every day there's usually a different variation of hot breakfast. Like one day it was scrambled eggs, potatoes, sliced sausage, the next it was mini cheese omelettes, French toast sticks and crispy  bacon. My favorite was they had mini bagels topped with eggs bacon and cheese sooo good. One morning I went all-out and made a waffle topped with peanut butter/banana and chocolate. 

So I booked a month in advance at $120/night, it seemed pretty firm in price as it didn't get any more expensive the closer it got to our stay. At this rate it's still affordable, its also got an indoor pool and a fitness room which I didn't use but they're good amenities to have.

If there was anything I would change it would be for it to be pet friendly. I did see a couple of guests walking their yorkie dog around in the building, they even brought it into the breakfast area which is NOT okay in my opinion. Most likely a fake service dog because it was seen with either the husband or wife. Normally service dogs stay with ONE person, not either-or (sorry, end rant)

Would I stay here again? Absolutely!... as long as it's affordable. I took off one star because of the leftover used soap & trashcans full (check-in) and housekeeping issue on day 3 but I genuinely enjoyed the stay.",1,NZfw5IMqxPn45YonsEJqkQ

To be so condescendingly admonished without her having asked if I indeed was sick, is beyond my comprehension. And indeed she did try to admonish me.  ""Uhm, yeah, I'm going to rebook you. You shouldn't come to a place like this if you are sick."" 

And then after I informed her that I have allergies, she lamented ""you have allergies?"" with a sneer on her face.

My time was wasted. And I subsequently will now cancel four more appointments for myself and my partner that all were to take place this week before the new year arrives. I'm sure I won't be able to find another RMT that has openings such short notice.

My wife used to live in the area, always brought her dogs there, and we thought the service was great. So much so that we paid their premium prices and drove all the way down from the city.

The vets were always super-friendly and knowledgeable. We even brought our one dog here for an expensive tooth extraction.

In the last year or so, service has gone drastically downhill. We would show up early for appointments, and still wait 20+ minutes in the waiting room, and another 20+ minutes in the exam room.

One Sunday, my dog's medicine that he needs daily hadn't shown up in the mail, so I called up and asked to come get an emergency supply of a few pills. In addition to charging 1.5x-2x the price we found elsewhere, there was also a $10 dispensing fee, and then a $25 ""emergency"" fee on top of that.

Despite the fact we're regular customers who have spent a considerable amount of money there (the aforementioned surgery, plus no less than $400 per visit multiple times per year), were in a somewhat critical jam, and drove a good distance just to patronize this particular vet, they weren't willing to waive either of the two fees. The receptionist explained that it's to prevent people from calling in for minor things in off-hours... a situation which this was not.

Being agitated that I had to pay for the privilege of paying for 14 pills what we were paying for 90 elsewhere, I commented that it was ""fucking ridiculous"". The next day when the lead vet called to discuss my dog's prescription with my wife, she commented that it was inappropriate for me to be cursing at her receptionist.

That lecture about my ""inappropriate language"" was the last straw. I'm clearly agitated and frustrated, and this receptionist complains to her boss that I cursed? Give. Me. A. Break.

I'm sad to end a relationship with a vet we liked, but ever-increasing wait times, service that is no longer worth a premium, unwillingness to be flexible with regular customers who are in a jam, and endless nickel and diming with fees means that we have switched to a new vet in the city.",21,FDr3AV8GwfPDOYYoe-yXRA

Unlike every other time I had ever been pierced at a shop or tattooed, I was not given any paperwork or a leaflet with care instructions or aftercare. I was only told to ""put some contact solution on it.""

Now a year later the piercing has been badly infected, such that I had to take the jewelry out, and it has closed, and I'm now on my fourth doctor and I've been on antibiotics since February 2020. My doctor suspects a staff infection and possibly metal embedded in the piercing... Nobody actually told me what kind of metal was used for my original piercing.

One note for context, while I know a bunch of physicians, I don't know anyone who works at or for GI Consultants on either the staff or doctor side.

Overall, I thought the process of setting up a new patient appointment was actually quite good.

After calling, I was greeted politely by what I'm assuming was the main receptionist and she transferred me to the scheduling department. The automated system told me I was fourth in line, but then the line was answered fairly quickly. I told the scheduler that I was referred about a month ago (yes, I procrastinated about scheduling a colonoscopy. Surprise. Surprise) but apparently that info isn't saved for too long (my guess, not her statement), so we just started from scratch.  Even with that it didn't take long to give her my primary care and insurance info, answer a bunch of questions about my size and family/personal medical history, and get the appointment scheduled.

Given my wife's schedule (they said I would need a driver) they were able to find a time only three weeks out on the day she has off, so that was great as well.

Overall, I really liked my experience.

The pastries here are LIT. We ordered the cruller and the jalouise which looks like a fancy pop tart. Cruller is a must have. The pop tart is kind of bland and dry. Maybe pop tarts TM have set the bar too high.

Chrissy chickpea hummus was unique in flavor 

Chicken shish kabob plate comes with one chicken skewer. This comes with hummus so ordering a separate chick pea hummus was a little bit of a hummus overload

The only small complaint I have is really just my personal preference. The restaurant is divided into different seating areas. I'm not fond of the one to the far right side of the front door, and it's the only one we have ever been seated in. It has a rather sterile feel, as if you're segregated from the rest of the restaurant, and it has a cold, very plain (although nice) feeling to the decor. Sort of weird and hard to explain. If you want a much quieter option, make this your request.

I stayed in a gorgeous, clean apartment for our fabulous weekend!  All the amenities of home. Great staff and location near CBD and Canal street within walking distance. Sometimes street parking was available, but if not we bought an in/out pass with a garage about a block away.

If you're looking for a tart treat, Whirled Peace is your place. The tart options run the gamut from traditional tart to lip-puckering passion fruit (like WHOA this is awesome...) to tongue caressing coconut.

...but their sweet selection is limited...very limited...like 3 flavors limited: strawberry, vanilla, and chocolate - all of which are really mediocre in terms of flavor potency.

Toppings are more traditional...like as in go to the grocery store and buy some things that you would put on yogurt including fruity pebbles and smashed-up peanut buttercups. 

...but Whirled Peace doesn't offer cookie dough or brownie chunks.

Even still, WP does provide Ghirardelli syrups/ice cream toppings INCLUDING peanut butter, white chocolate, milk chocolate, dark chocolate and caramel sauces. (And we all know that Ghirardelli is the best. After all, there wouldn't be so many models lusting after Ghirardelli chocolates in deep voices on TV if Ghirardelli didn't make rockin' chocolate.)

And, to their credit, you can mix your own smoothie. That's pretty neat. Get creative. Throw some blueberries and heath bars in a mango juice smoothie blended with vanilla ice cream...or not.",3,VEj1OuO6QrQMXFhuMZJ8cQ

They tore up the original purchase paperwork and rewrote it because the car had too, many miles to be considered new.

Be that as it may, I have had issue upon issue with the vehicle since its purchase and resorted to writing to the corporate office to have at least one major issue corrected.

For drinks I would definitely recommend just going with a bottle of win from the front. I went upstairs to order a drink, and while their specialty drinks are delicious, they're all small for the price paid. Also, their ATM downstairs doesn't always work, so you may have to go use another ATM if you don't have cash on you.

According to past yelpers, the Hyatt seemed like the clear choice. I definitely agree with the other yelpers. Even though it cost a bit more ($100 for a Queen Double) than other hotels nearby, it was definitely worth it. First of all, there is no casino here, so although the outside of the building looks a bit homely, the inside is clean and modern and comfortable (and smoke-free!!). All the staff members were friendly and helpful as far as I could tell. Our room was spacious and the furnishings seemed new and well-kept. The TV in the room was also very modern, which I appreciated. Also, our room had a small divider between the living space and the beds, which was nice because no one went to sleep at the same time. It would have been nice to have some more chairs in the room, but that wasn't a huge issue.

Before booking the room, I saw on the website that there was free wifi and complimentary continental breakfast. They came through on both these promises. The wifi was very fast and easy to connect to. The continental breakfast was served downstairs. It wasn't the fanciest meal ever, but it was complimentary, so I'm not complaining. There was coffee, milk, juices, muffins, donuts, fruit, and toast to name a few choices. There was also a 24 hour cafe, a fitness area, and an indoor swimming pool. We were in a hurry, so we didn't get to check those out, but I guess it was nice to know that it was available. 

Overall, I had a great experience at this place. I'm giving it 4/5 stars because even though it lacked the luxury and extensive amenities of a huge 5 star hotel, it was definitely clean and hospitable.

The music volume was set to high and the choice of music genre was quite jaunting, considering the small interior and applied effort to laid back comfort.The customer service was hit or miss, us being newbies to the causual pint, we had no clue we had to go up to the bar to be served..... i just assumed since they offer food service with a kitchen we would be greeted and offered a menu.... well none of that happened...it's all a shame to because they did have a decent beer menu and offered quite a variety of drafts with some local breweries tossed in. there was a lot of loud screaming over the crowd...by one of the employee's actually... it also was very jaunting and distracting from the social chatter

we never saw any menu's so we didn't get to try the food, and brats are always an appealing menu item to my carniverous habits. to be fair i can say this place isn't all that bad, just not my cup of tea...I admit i am just lame and old and not hip enough for the radio friendly hop these days...and if i wanted to hear a drunk chick scream over a crowd i would call one of my ex's up.....The beer selection is fair and engrossing enough for a ""casual"" beer connoisseur....but the problem is this place has an identity crisis and can not make it's mind up.......if it wants to be a downtown Nashville honky tonk gone urban tourist bar or a more trendy, tavern, gastro pub type deal.... it was all just unpleasantly loud, plus the initial lackluster customer service.

Want to know how Michelle Obama got her arms? Well hard work & solidcore. This studio started in the DC region and has expanded rapidly. This location is the third one in the Indianapolis area now. Compared to clay terrace this location is much larger. 

Connected to the river house apartment building the parking is seemingly okay. There is some street parking out front - but to be honest I parked in the urgent care center lot. 

The studio has a nice check in area, plenty of lockers and two bathrooms and changing rooms. There is  water fountain as well. The lobby also has water for sell as well as merchandise. 

The studio featuring sweatlana - the one of a kind solidcore machine - has about 20 stations. It's equipped with amazing audio and mirrors on front and back walls to watch your form. 

The coach guides you through quick paced, yet slow and controlled movements. You'll do a lot of planking. You'll do some hellish butt work. The arms have a moment too. And you'll always, always do obliques. Get ready to come in and shake.

The rolls here are huge. You will not be able to fit one into your mouth (that's what she said). You have to bite it in half and eat it that way.

They have several board games to pass time with friends, a couch, wifi - all clearly with the intention of catering to the student and work-from home employee in all of us. I haven't yet dared to venture to try their snacks, but am absolutely in love with the Jasmine Milk Tea with boba. The boba is chewy, but not soggy and gross. The flavor itself is absolute heaven. I have not yet been able to find another flavor, but this is most directly related to the fact that I don't have the heart to order something OTHER than the Jasmine flavor. They've strangely predicted this predicament, as they now offer two-flavor cups. Maybe next time...

I'd complain about the price, but the reality is that I dish it out every time. I think the biggest drawback is that as soon as I get my boba tea, I sip at it constantly and it quite literally doesn't last the drive back to wherever it is I'm going.I think more size options would need to be in place to make me completely happy. I'd need at least a Pawnee Regular size to last me a lunch hour. The services is great. I normally get my boba with less than a 3- minute turn around time.

It's a challenge to take over a location where the previous owner did so poorly, so I hope everyone gives this place a chance.

We entered thru the back entrance for better parking,and were greeted by not only the servers but also everyone in the kitchen, starting the evening very pleasantly.   I feel we were given very good attention all evening, with various checks to make sure the food was good, and the surprise of complementary appetizers was great.   However, the arrival of food was sporadic and a bit strange - the rice was the very last thing to appear, after all other food had been consumed over a quite long period of time.   As it was their grand opening and they were trying to give the appetizers to everyone, cooked fresh for each table, plus the dim sum cooked-to-order, I imagine it was quite a challenge for the kitchen and timing will improve.

Best dish, for me, was the Honey Pepper Shrimp.  I wish the rice had come sooner so I could have bathed it in the sauce that was heavenly, but that's a minor complaint.  It was absolutely scrumptious and I would make sure to always order it.   Other dishes were okay, none had me ready to cheerlead for them, but none ""awful.""

Resnick came to inspect my toilet, which was running, in September 2013. Murray, the owner, gave me two estimates for both the part (a fill valve) and labor--one for $250 for a plastic fill valve and one for $375 for a brass fill valve--and I chose the cheaper one since he said there was no difference. The part took a week longer to come in than estimated, but I had the work done. When the plumber completed the work, he told me that the cost would be $375! (I can't help but notice that this is not the only review on Yelp in which someone says that Murray randomly changed the price on them, so this is not an anomaly. It's how they do business). When I told him that I was quoted at $250 and had an Angie's List coupon for 10% off, he said ok and took my check for $225. 

However, the toilet kept running and when the plumber returned to address the problem, he told me that his boss asked for the coupon back because we'd ""shorted him substantially."" Needless to say, I refused, explaining that a) that's false advertising with the coupon and b) it's not my fault they may have accidentally ordered and installed an expensive part I did not ask for. He agreed and we left it at that.

Fast forward 9 months and guess what breaks? The very fill valve he installed. We call Resnick to let Murray know, and he claims he has no records of the specific part he installed or where he got it from, so there's no way of knowing if it's under warranty. I have never heard of a business that does not keep any records.  
Furthermore, he has no interest in helping us out in any other way. I cannot explain what a nightmare it has been dealing with this company, but they are to be avoided at all costs if you don't want to lose $225 like we did only to wind up with a toilet that's still broken.

We sat at the chefs counter which is the best spot in the restaurant if it's just two of you. It's awesome to watch the chefs work and the counter offers plenty of elbow space, so being crammed is not a concern. We dined in on Tuesday night and every single seat was taken- these guys are clearing killing it. 

We totally over did it on food but it was so worth it. We kicked things off with an order of the croquettes- the Romesco sauce served alongside them was packed with flavor and really made the dish pop. Definitely recommend this dish. After that we ordered the French Onion soup, one of our personal faves. The serving is ample and oh so good. It hit the spot on a cold winter night. After that we waiting awhile and enjoyed the view of the action in the kitchen while we visited. For our mains we ordered the Mussels and two sides: meatballs and brusselsprouts. Given how quickly the mussels come together, it was floored at the amazing flavor of the broth. The urge to pick up the bowl and drink it- was real. The meatballs were delicious as well, served in a creamy mustard style sauce, completely unique and would order gain. The Brusselsprouts were perfection and addicting. 

Long story short- the caliber of Petite 4 is unlike anything else you will find in Boise. The food is too notch, don't let the simple menu fool you, the uniqueness and creativity of the dishes is all part of the experience. The serve and bar are equally as impressive. The abundance of 5 star reviews tells you there is no such thing as an ""off"" night at this place- you can expect perfection every single time. So if your looking to impress the in laws, step your game up for date night or just pamper yourself, this is your place. Look no further. 

Little did we know that a dynamite and unassuming sandwich shop in Boise would ultimately flower into this incredible little gem of a restaurant- and thank god it it.",5,PUQFBO57wiRZRnUOpaiSXw

I've taken several investment courses over the years. 
Some I have paid for, some were free. These other courses made me aware that there was a simpler way to sell options without day trading, but none of them gave any details unless I spent thousands more with them.
So I was specifically looking for an options course that taught what the other courses hinted.

I came across Ron and Global Trading at the start of 2014 and it was clear to me right away that he was teaching these options strategies. 
The concepts are actually easier than the platform used for the trading.
It is definitely an Art and a Science.

It's important to know that anything in the financial industry is NOT one size fits all.. 
And anything with investments involves risk which differs for each person..
Ron does an AMAZING job of addressing each persons specific situations and needs.
Specific guidelines for one person does not apply to everyone.
UNFORTUNATELY, some students don't understand this and take too much time with unimportant, irrelevant questions that involve their own trading methods and not Ron's.

After a year and a half and several of Ron's courses, his claims have been ABSOLUTELY true and he has never been misleading. I've seen other misleading speakers in the industry and Ron is a rare teacher I'm lucky to have found... EVEN while witnessing some of his students make learning difficult for themselves and the rest of us.

The plumber was at my house within the time framework given to us by the dispatcher. He was poilte and capable. However, he did not shut both of the bathroom sink's valves before removing the levers to check the inside cartridge for faults (since I had called about a drip/leak) . I specifically indicated he needed to shut both valves, something I could not do because of lacking the finger strength, hence the reason to call in this very expensive service. Said that several times. Well, he shut only one. So, when the other one popped off the defective cartridge and the water came exploding out of the cold water outlet, I was the one who was sent running to the basement, two floors, to shut the main valve. Could have hurt myself as I am not the youngster this plumber was. And all because, as he explained after he, then I, mopped up the water off the floor and tried to get some of it out of the carpet located outside the threshold, said that this popping off wasn't supposed to happen. I guess this young man has not learned enough to plan for worst case scenarios or contingencies, and I told him so. Nicely enough, but firmly. And he believed that just by saying it never happens made he lack of caution and preparation and his disregarding of what I said all okay...even though I had water descending the pipes into the basement two stories below.

I confronted him with this and asked for some financial consideration for his mistake.  He at first tried to argue, gently, that it was not a mistake because, once again, it wasn't supposed to happen and never had. I kept repeating he did not do the type of preparation for such conditions to arise and that IS a mistake. I could have said that obviously the time in the field was not adequate for him to be making such blanket statements, but he remained polite throughout so I did not wish to hint of any insults to his knowledge or skill.He eventually said that he could not change the flat fee for the service, but could give me the two cartridges for free. I agreed to that, nominal as it was, sheer lay for the point of the matter.

In comclusion, I gave this service three stars because he fixed the problem and he remained polite throughout this minor mess. But I am not happy with this particular experience. And the rates for this company, as noted on other reviews, is high for such easy (usually) services. But I have had good service from the Levittown subcontractor and cannot complain. They were however, more complex jobs. You can read my other recent review, which was sterling. But again, these were more complex jobs performed under more duress. I guess my disappointment here was in being disregarded and in how this youngster in the field believe that just because something isn't supposed to happen, or has happened already, that it will never happen.

I was in the market for a 2020 Silverado and was very upfront that I was shopping at a few other dealerships to get the best deal. With several Chevy dealerships within a roughly 30 mile radius I thought this should be quick and easy. I did internet pricing research, contacted dealerships by phone to confirm availability and price, and checked KBB/comps for my trade in. I set out with Don Brown as my first stop and hooked up with Rodney Earl. I told Rodney I was shopping around and right away he was determined to make me a loyal customer by giving me the best experience possible. Rodney, and sales manager Tim, worked with me on my trade and although they ended up being just short of the best deal (I didn't try to get them to counter), I went with them based on customer service alone. 
In my run around the St Louis area dealerships I heard one word over and over, Loyalty. When I told dealers I was shopping around I was immediately told they were more interested in loyalty than a customer who shops for the best deal. One dealership interaction lasted just 10 minutes before they walked me out of the door stating they didn't want to deal with me since I wasn't a loyal customer.

I've attended 3 shows here and plan to attend more. I'd love to be a season ticket holder sometime in the next few years. Seats are a bit dated and uncomfortable by the end of a show, sound quality is a-ok. I've sat in the ""good"" and the ""bad"" seats, and I could see the stage well from all vantage points. The lobby area seems extra small, but I'm not sure I've been to many theatres that have ample lobby space. 

I appreciate the bathroom attendants at intermission for helping the bathroom line move. I wish they'd fence the port-a-potty section in a way that you don't have to go back through the security line and re-scan your ticket. 

We usually eat somewhere on University before a show and also Park there if we can find parking. Tyndall garage is free on weekends, but takes a while to get out after a show, so beware! Find street parking or pay if you can find a lot with spaces left.",3,6Dwh99zbe_lhfOD4MiAM1g

What I WASN'T prepared for was the flat I got days later on the repaired wheel while I was on a long ride. When I took it to another bike shop, they let me know that the rim tape that was on the new wheel was in fact many years old, and the bike shop had used the rim tape from my original wheel rather than putting on a new $2 rim tape, causing the spoke to puncture my tube. Taking that kind of shortcut to save a couple bucks, putting someone in danger of being stranded, is why this place gets one star. Yes, the owner was nice, and yes, the dog is cute, but a bike shop needs to be a lot more. Purchased a new spare kit from the other bike shop so I could change my own tire if I get stranded again, because this was certainly a learning experience.",5,3HvdQKAc2FYFSOMbgRAfKg

Our waiter was rather young and nonchalant. He greeted us as if he just wanted to get us out of the way. He was not very welcoming at all. First issue, we put our non-alcoholic drink requests in while looking over the menu for appetizers and mixed drink choices. Our waiter took a while to return back to our table. Now considering the amount of people in the place that night, I can understand why things wouldn't happen as smoothly or as fast as we would prefer. Ok, so, we notice that the time is ticking and that we wanted to order as many drinks was we could during happy hour, but our waiter was still M.I.A (missing in action). So in effort to assure that we made our request known ahead of time, we called over another waiter to the table to have him
notify our waiter that we were ready to place our ""happy hour"" drink orders. He said ""ok, I'll go get him"". 
Still, our waiter takes the longest time to get to our table,  at this point we are ten minutes away from happy hour ending. We just assumed that maybe he would accommodate our order, seeing as though we made the request known prior to, and also granted the inconvenience of his return timing. Well, he came to our table and we said that we were ready to order drinks,  an appetizer and our meal now that we had enough time to glance at the menu and decide. He went around the table and took our individual orders. Luckily, my friend's husband asked the waiter before leaving the table, about the drinks being on happy hour price. Mind you, there was literally a minute left before time was up. 
He looked at his watch and said, well... it's basically over. We expressed how we had been waiting and even sent for him in effort to meet the time but he looked annoyed at our persistence and said "" well I'll go ask them"" (whoever them is). He came back and said, no I'm sorry happy hour is over. We said, "" so even though this was not our fault but yours, the place will not make an exception on our behalf. He said "" no I'm sorry"" but with this attitude like (i wish y'all would shut up). So we told him at this point we didn't want drinks. Price wasn't the issue, fairness was. Deciding amongst ourselves on whether to leave or
not, unfortunately I was the one to insist that we stay because I heard that the place was really
good and I didn't want a young, inexperienced server to be the reason that we missed out on this great meal. So everyone grudgingly decided to stay, upon my request. Ok. Sooo our appetizers and food come. Our waiter was no where to be seen. We actually saw him behind the counter talking about us. He literally, was pointing to us and venting to a coworker bc he was upset about the fact that we said we would speak to the owner on the issue. So from that moment on, we had terrible service and a bad attitude from him.
We decided to not finish our meal there, we would take it to go. We sent for him (yet again) and asked for the check. We get the check and we notice gratuity was already added (we didn't plan on leaving a tip at all). So we asked him why, he said bc we have a party of 5 or more. We said, no we have a party of 4 and two babies who were sleep in car seats and did not eat or order. He said well they still count and that's the rule (in an arrogant way). We asked to see a manager and Tiffany  came to the table and we explained the entire issue (drinks, service and tip issue) she said that she was sorry about the experience but those sleeping babies still counted as a party of 5 or more and that the rule of the house was they any party seated in that booth is an automatic added gratuity. We told her that he did not mention that to us and naturally we wouldn't care, we are all pretty decent tippers. We just wanted the option to not tip him. I'm certain had this been a table where he wasn't guaranteed to get a tip he would've been a nicer server. His arrogance came solely from the fact that he was getting a tip regardless of how he treated us. The manager had an unforgiving, impatient attitude as well. You can tell he prepped her for us. My friends husband told her that he too owned a business and that he found this experience to be absurd and that we would no longer be spending money at this establishment. She said, that was fine but we were still obligated to pay the fee plus gratuity. We paid and left. I never write reviews. I hate taking the time to. I'd prefer to just not go to the place. But given the fact that I was the reason that we stayed and that my friends were forced to pay for bad service plus tip. I felt compelled to share my experience. I will not ever revisit this place. And I am disappointed to see that a black owned business doing so well would not take pride in customer service.",0,Mm6WTsdPHxfRSIlFYg1hGQ

Chicken and waffles with a side of country gravy and  a Cajun omelet with hash browns and a biscuit. The chicken is great but the waffle was so so sooogggyyy! It was flimsy and felt like someone dipped it in water. The country gravy is severely under seasoned with and tasted like canned gravy. Didn't eat the waffle or the gravy just the chicken. 

The omelet was over cooked and the egg dried out and had that weird egg film on them that happens when you over cook an omelet. The biscuit was also soggy but some how dry at the same time. 

Would not recommend for breakfast especially to go. If you go just get chicken. It's the only thing we enjoyed and the only reason for two stars Perhaps it's better in person based on the reviews but I would never return. Sad to have wasted a meal here when in New Orleans.",0,JY0us6aPvS2g5M7yy2_HsA

We first went to Sizzle on the opening night. We didn't realize it was opening night until we were there and committed. Opening night was crazy. The wait for a pizza was 1 1/2 hrs. We had a table so no problem. It was a problem for people there with small children that weren't told it would be such a long wait. The pizza was delicious. We had a White Walker, It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia and garlic knots. 

So we went back last night and when we went in it wasn't busy. Ordered a White Walker and garlic knots. Was told it would be 45 minutes for the pizza but knots wouldn't take that long. Unfortunately that was not true. At just over 50 min we checked and our food was ready and sitting on the counter. We tried to take it but they said they'd bring it. Another 5 min. We are not sure how long it had been sitting. Both the pizza and knots were still warm but not super hot like our previous meal.  The food was good. The only ranch dressing they offer is vegan. I didn't try it but my daughter didn't like it. I think they should consider offering a regular ranch  dressing. 

Last night after we sat down at a table near the door, they propped the door open and it soon was freezing so we had to move to the back of the restaurant. It was still pretty cold back there too. 

I hope they can improve the speed at which they can prepare an order and deliver it in a timely manner. Most reviewers like the pizza but have a hard time with the wait time. It's definitely not a place to go if you are starving and want food quickly.",1,2-ix-EF8vUoBY_S_MQHjFQ

ON MAN!!!! This place absolutely rocks! I believe it is the best straight up Thai food in Nashville. Better than Smiling Elephant, which is my #2 (due to its ""not the usual"" Thai recipes). The sisters that run this place are friendly and the recipies are out of this world! The spicing of the individual dishes standout and show the true multiple favorites in each Thai dish. Instead of single over powering spice you get the rainbow of flavors that you expect from HIGH END places.

Unfortunately, the closest Mi Quang, a Central Vietnamese specialty, is in Portland, but Pho 79 is among a few Boise restaurants to serve Bun Bo Hue.

I was surprised to find some really nasty Yelp reviews of Pho 79. Nasty: Empty at dinner time; dirty; low-quality meat; worst pho ever; ghetto; bland; filthy; stay away!!

Still, I had to try it. Maybe the other reviewers came on a bad day or bad year. Or maybe it's improved since then. Whatever the reason, I had a good meal here.

I've complained that other Vietnamese restaurants serving soup don't work their broth enough. The best are simmered for hours and the flavor is so intense you'd be happy simply slurping the broth by itself.

This wasn't the best Bun Bo Hue I've ever had. That's served up by the Portland eatery Bun Bo Hue on 82nd Street. But the Pho 79 version was good, the best I've had in Boise.

The servers were bringing out samples of the deep dish cheese pizza for the waiting patrons. (nicely done BJ's). 

Hubby made his way to the bar as there were 10 minutes left in Happy Hour. The long dark haired bartender was extremely rude when my hubby asked for the Happy Hour menu. She huffed very loudly that I heard her from behind my hubby and tossed the menu at him from the middle of the bar. (only negative of the evening) He was done with her at that point. The very nice lighter haired bearded gentleman was more than happy to take the order for a glass of wine and a rum and coke. Hubby tips him very well.

Before we knew it, our table was ready. The server with long blondish hair was more then happy to take our order for HONEY SRIRACHA BRUSSELS SPROUTS $6.75 and CALIFORNIA CLUB FLATBREAD $11.50 to get us started off. The atmosphere was bubbly as so many tables were celebrating birthdays. The appetizers showed up quickly, correctly, and hot. Both were crazy good. Recommend them!

For entrees, I had the SHRIMP QUINOA BOWL $14.75 and the hubby ordered the SLOW-ROASTED TRI-TIP with Caprese Salad and WHITE CHEDDAR MASHED POTATOES $16.95. After some delightful conversation, we ordered a BJ'S BERRY BURST CIDER® $6.50 and BJ'S JEREMIAH RED $5.95.  The food came out perfectly. It was so incredible tasty.

The evening was relaxing while tasty. I highly recommend coming here for your night out if you can get away from the kids for a meal with your love.",34,TThz1MQ2SCb7L48MqoRoLw

No towels in a bathroom that couldn't possibly have ever been cleaned. I bought stuff myself and scrubbed it down!  2nd night I kept hearing scratching noises and within the hour saw a huge, apperently well fed, mouse. After jumping on the bed (which is in no way a queen but a full size) I go to the desk to let them know. The guy just stood there dumbfounded like it was normal and I was being ""extra"". I asked if they at least had any kind of trap or something. Right under the desk, readily available, he reaches in and hands me 2 traps. The peanut butter for bait was right there too! He put some in the traps and showed me how to work them. I swear I didn't have them down for 30 minutes when both traps were set off. You could only imagine what was going through my mind at that point.  I got brave, bagged up the traps and took them to the desk to prove I wasn't over reacting. When I asked for 2 more my response was ""I'm sorry, only two per guest"". I was in such disbelief all I could do was sarcastically laugh. That morning I asked to at least trade rooms but couldn't sure to it being booked up. I literally had to stay there for the entire week due to transportation/work issues etc. In those few days there was an overdose, a fight, usually large groups of people hanging out at all hours. I wondered about a police presence and with that being said... On day 6 , around 10am 4 cars come flying in... Cops running around with revolvers pulled. I hauled ass to my room to see them kick in MY neighbors door and bring out some guy. Sadly, all this stuff isn't even unusual for places like this in this area. I've been homeless now for a little while and have stayed in better and worse places. Better as in, they looked better and better maintained but the same things happen. Worse as in, I had to give CPR after a young girl was dragged from a room to the stairwell because she overdosed and nobody wanted to get busted.  If you have nowhere else to go this place is doable as long as you keep to yourself. I've found over time that if you really want to know what kind of place you're getting into... Call the local PD. They'll let you know if they are called there and how often. At least the Wi-Fi was decent, AC was cold all for around $65 during the week and $80 a day on Fridays and Saturdays.

I absolutely love the outdoor seating. The seating is mostly in a wind shadow so as long as the weather is mild/warm, the experience outside will be great. The indoor seating is sort of limited but they do have a loft upstairs for additional seating. 

Eclipse has a very well developed menu with lots of different options. I'm a huge fan of all that they have to offer and I love the variety. If you are underwhelmed by the menu, you can always create your own pizza. One thing that is unique is that almost half of the pizzas on the menu come with a pesto sauce rather than a marinara sauce (so for people like my tomato-hating boyfriend, this is the place to go!). So far I have only tried the Ironman pizza, but I'm looking forward to going back to Eclipse and trying their other options. 

The small pizza is 10"" and is a personal size. The medium is perfectly shareable for 2 people. The dough is hand made and tossed and turns into an absolutely lovely pizza crust. It is thin enough to have some crunch but is thick enough to support the bold flavors.",4,629zIpQCFaHgVZZVQKdpew

Today's offering was grilled chicken, falafel, hummus, rice with chick peas and 3 small plums. The portion was abundant and more than enough to share between 2 people (""Did you share, Sam?"" [""no comment']).
My one chief complaint is that the rice and chick peas were cold. I think he has the platters ready to go which accounts for that. I think it would have been more palatable if it were hot.

I've gotten takeout from here once and lunch twice and all of my experiences have been exceptional. The interior truly makes you feel like you are in an upscale restaurant for a happy hour with friends or celebrating an anniversary. Everything here is made fresh to order, has a unique Chrysalis twist (the champagne pistachio dressing on the house salad should be sold by the bottle. It is so freaking good), and reminds me of eating in much pricier Italian places in bigger cities. The salicce flatbread comes out with oozy, delicious cheese and sausage and sauce and is not to be missed. I'd also really recommend the limoncello trifle for dessert, which is light, tart, and refreshing, even after a heavier meal. All that aside, the true gem of Chrysalis and the reason I will soon be a regular is their knockout bar program.

Anyway, my friends and I booked a room here for a popular festival weekend. When we called to confirm, Brian Krason (the rudest manager) I've ever dealt with, told us he was increasing the room rate ON THE SPOT because we had 3 people instead of 2. Now, as you know, that doesn't change the number of beds or anything, for that matter. But, okay. So my friend asked him why and Brian didn't feel the need to explain to the customer why our rate was increasing.

Instead of explaining why he was increasing the price, he cancelled the reservation. No warning. No confirmation. Just cancelled it. Then sent a snarky email about why he was cancelling the reservation which boiled down to his pride being hurt over being told that this was the worst customer service we had ever received. (Which is a fact.) We then tried to speak with someone else and Brian repeatedly sent us to voicemail. 

I say all this to say, Brian Krason is unprofessional. If he won't honor a pre-determined room rate, what else would he slack on? Maintenance? Sanitation?

Time to shut the store down, it has the Verizon name on it, but there are no services offered - NONE.  Can't even call, no pick up.  Yet all the employees are sitting around chatting without a single customer in the store.  

They are destroying the Verizon brand, would think you would investigate if you really cared what customers are experiencing!

And NO, I really don't want to go back.  Resistance outside the store to see products I wanted to purchase, going to Best Buy.",1,78Zk8MVGUgTJBjULuzJG9Q

For me, the menu was just right for this type of place.  Interesting, but nothing too fancy for the regular folks coming through the door.  You'll be disappointed if you came for the foie gras appetizer. 

I came with my daughter for dinner yesterday.  She had the kids chicken strips, which tasted really good and for $4 was a decent deal.   I asked for a suggestion and the waitress mentioned the basic Haven burger, which is a bacon cheeseburger.  It's kind of what I had in mind coming in, so okay.   I asked for medium, but I didn't see any pink.  Still, I'm not fussy about that, since it was really juicy and just a great burger.  I think I saw another review mention thick-sliced bacon, but this was just regular bacon cooked perfectly.  For a side, I upgraded to fried pickles, a Haven specialty.  They were as good as any I've ever had, and I've had some really good ones.  The burger and fried pickles made an awesome meal.  Way too much food, but I ate it all anyway.  My doctor would have been very disappointed. 

I do have a minor complaint about the service:   Did you ever have a meal where you weren't really sure who your waitress is?   That's how my meal at the Haven went yesterday.  I really do appreciate when the wait staff helps each other out - everyone wins:  customers get good service and the servers get good tips.  In this case, though, I kind of felt like the new waitress had kind of ""stolen"" the other server's table.  It kind of made me feel like I was aiding and abetting, especially when the second waitress brought the bill and ran the credit card.  It's not like the first one left or anything; she brought us a refill pretty late in the process.  Kind of weird.  I hope the first waitress got at least part of the tip.   

Bottom line:  Nice bar and grill, good service, great food.  We'll definitely be back.",3,Hxx8FmhpxiugIrGRh8RDOg

If the Chatt isn't fantastic and you don't love it, don't pay for it either.

Well, needless to say I paid for both!  He has many different varieties, combination of Lassi's as well as different combos of Chatt.  He gave me a wonderful education on Chatt and said that he would make me a vegetarian chatt.  I have eaten at many Indian restaurants, but have never had Chatt.

This is a review for sales, and for service.

Sales - 5 Stars
Peter C. was a wonderful sales man to work with.  He was no pressure, the test drive went well, showed me what all the fancy buttons did, the navigation system, and of course pointed out all the cup holders (haha)   He recognized I was nervous as I was there by myself - when he started going over all the options and packages and extended warranty this and that I did get a bit overwhelmed so I asked if I could come back the next day with my bf to advise me....Peter was more than accommodating and didn't pressure me like I've had some salesmen do in the past.  I've had comments such as ""You're a big girl, you can make decisions by yourself!""  from other dealerships - so I was very happy that Peter respected me with my request.

I came back the next day, had the bf give it the once over and a quick test drive and he gave it the stamp of approval.  I got down to business with the financial department who again went over the extended warranty options - with my bf listening to see if it was worth it, I went for it and happy that I did.  The financial woman I worked with was a very sweet and bought us over some freshly baked cookies since we had been there through dinner time (probably could hear our stomachs growling!)  I was very happy with my experience with sales - that was def 5 stars.

The waiting area is very comfortable, complimentary wifi and light refreshments (coffee, water, cookies)


SERVICE ISSUES - 1 Star!!!!!!!!!!!
Why I had to knock down to 1 stars, was because I had a problem with the brakes only 2 days later.  Thompson fell short on a SAFETY issue - directly putting MY safety, and the public's safety at risk!  My brakes started grinding terribly and choppy stopping, not something that should happen!  When I called service, the (gentle)man that I spoke to was SO condescending, spoke to me as if I didn't even know that the sky was blue.  He told me it was normal and just brake dust, I should continue driving the car and it would work itself out - how can he diagnose something over the phone without seeing the car?  I told him this was not normal new brake-in wear, this was something serious, the car was NOT acting properly and it was a hazard to drive.  I requested they flat bed me a loaner and take my car back to be assessed.  This was a complimentary service that was touted to me during my purchasing process.  He refused at first, and told me to drive it back.  I could NOT believe it.  I thought Thompson had a good reputation, a care for their customers safety?  Guess I was wrong.  I told him I was not comfortable driving the car in its current state, and that I felt it was unsafe.  So I hung up and thought about calling and paying out of pocket for a tow.  My bf arrived home, I was crying at this point and recounted what had happen and he took the car for a spin around the block.  He confirmed it was NOT right, a safety issue and the car was not safe to drive.  So he called back and had it out with the service manager.  My bf knows a thing or two about cars, and after the service manager asking him basically ""what do you know about cars"" - my bf told him exactly what he knows about cars and who he works for and only then did they relent to send a loaner out to me and take my car back to the dealership.  It was 10:00pm at night by the time the loaner got to me.  If only the service manager heeded me in the first place when I called around 5pm would this not have been a debacle and this would have stayed a 5 star review.  In the end, part of the the brake mechanism became unseeded and they needed to repair it.  Turns out it was UNSAFE to drive!

I was never offered an apology when I picked up my car after repair.  It still pains me to bring my car back there for service.  I don't know if I'll use Thompson for my next Lexus after what happen....only time will tell.",8,W48aWI8oACKFjTt1hBZb8A

The food is amazing. You have to try their grilled biscuits and any of their specials. We went twice this weekend. I had the shrimp grillade one day and the brunch buffet the second day. The shrimp grillade was so well seasoned and filling for $10. I wish I'd remembered to take pictures. 

The breakfast brunch is about $20. It comes with access to the hot bar, salad bar, and made to order... I had scrambled eggs, fried chicken, mac and cheese. French toast.... it was great. My husband and I really enjoyed it.

If you're gonna go in a group, be prepared to have one person cover the bill and split it later. They don't split bills. Checks are per table... venmo and cash app are gonna be your friend's best friend here.",3,4oTxJmq5gBAu9fgVbLuBQg

We explained that we purchased accessible seats but clearly they were not as they did not remove the seats. They told us to hold on.. okay no problem. We see them standing in the next section just standing there doing absolutely nothing. Then Mary comes along telling us we can move to another section... which was further away, at the back of the stadium. Horrible seats compared to what we paid for so absolutely unacceptable. Telling us it wasn't their problem, and that we needed to contact Ticketmaster. We explained that we purchased these seats for a reason and if they show accessible they should have fixed them and honored our ticket. All she said was ""I have the right to give you another option"". Michael Jackson came along and said they were having a meeting about the situation, because maintenance didn't want to come correct the problem  and they and I quote said ""we don't know what to do with you"". 

So we stood their waiting for them to come back a whole 45 minutes later and asked if we could just go to a different accessible area. That was closer like we paid for. He said ""sure you can try"". The man wasn't even going to guide us there. We had to ask him too. He walked IN FRONT of us the whole time about 30 feet ahead, didn't say a word to us or the other family, didn't see to see if we were even behind him, zip zap nothing. Then just left us with some other woman. Who unfortunately was also extremely disrespectful and yelled at us and tried putting us in a location with a giant booth right in front of us so we couldn't see. What's the point of that? She's lucky I didn't get her name. Then who I'm assuming was the manager of them came down and talked to the mom that was with us. Saying she had 4 Ticketmaster reps on site and asked if we wanted to talk to them. Of course we wanted to at this point. SHE LEFT AND NEVER CAME BACK. 

We were excited but instead we had to deal with extremely rude staff, messed up seats, for an hour before the show started through all the openers as well. 

Raymond James you need to get it together and I HIGHLY recommend hiring a more hospitable staff that actually cares about the guest that enter that stadium or put them through some extensive training on customer service. If it were up to me Michael Jackson and Mary Sheffield would've been fired tonight. We have never felt so disrespected and the fact it came from every staff member we encountered. We are so let down that you guys would allow this. I will be calling higher ups as well as Ticketmaster since you guys insisted on that. Since ""it wasn't your problem and you didn't know what to do with us"" 

Maybe you all should considered communicating with the suppliers you're working for with a correct floor plan, honoring tickets. I more then likely won't be returning here. ‍",0,FvfDyp_Jy2ROFYQEB7GpMQ

So it's not your formal restaurant where you sit and have a waiter/waitress take your order- that is far too pompous. Nay, this is for the common folk who don't mind standing in lines to order, while smelling the greatest barbecued scent to ever grace your nose. This is for the hard working post-strawberry picking group of friends in dire straits for a hearty American meal. This is for anyone with an appetite. This is for you, random Yelp reader. 

ok so for an actual review: 
There's a line to order your food, then you go find a table and sit at it while food runners magically find you and deliver your wildest fantasies in the form of BBQ. I had the half-rack of ribs and my GOD. The next 5 minutes were spent in an almost-disgustingly gluttonous celebration of life and food as I dug my teeth into some of the best ribs ever. I would highly HIGHLY suggest the St. Louis sauce, as well as the white BBQ sauce (for all my horse radish lovers out there, holla!!). My friends got other things which I was told were amazing (such as the beef brisket and pulled pork) but I was far too busy to notice anything outside of the ribs in my hands. 

There were only a few sides listed on the formal menu, but a paper hung from the divine kitchen reading ""daily sides"" with enticing options such as ""Brisket chilli"", ""fried zucchini"", etc. - you could honestly (but shouldn't) throw a dart at it and pick whatever your dart landed on, and you'd be set.

The meal I had today was phenomenal; the kind of food that makes you feel good after you eat it, not just because you're supporting a very worthy organization, but because it's fresh, healthy food. 

Thanks to Liz for choosing this spot for our lunch meeting today. Otherwise, who knows how long I would've taken to get around to experiencing the awesome that is Liberty's Kitchen? 

They have a ton of vegetarian options, which I wasn't expecting, and is always a welcome surprise. Although I was inclined to get the black bean burger, I ended up going with the roasted vegetable quiche (best quiche I've ever had, hands down), roasted red pepper soup (tasty), and a ""classic"" side salad (fresh and just the right size.) 

Parking is kind of a pain, but there is a lot. Just be sure to park on the far side of the building - if you pull into the first parking lot (on the right, if you're looking at the building, and the first one you'll be able to turn into, due to the direction of traffic on that side of the street), you'll end up having to do a circle in order to park in the ""north"" lot (on the left of the building), lest whoever owns the other parking lot follows through on their threats to tow at owner's expense. 

I paid about $13 for my quiche, salad, a cup of soup and large iced green tea. The restaurant is setup cafe-style, so you order at the counter and they bring you your food (you get a little number thingy to put on your table so they can find you).

Cafeteria style offerings all looked good. While waiting pernil sandwiches were being made for some patrons. They were enormous. The selection is huge. Place was clean and the staff were friendly.

The service was friendly enough, don't get me wrong.  They had a sweet southern charm that I appreciated.

The fact is, the food was SO SO bad!!!

My family and I were staying right across the parking lot at the Hilton, and we didn't want to pay $10 per person for the buffet, and we needed something quick.  So we figured dunkin donuts would have what we needed.

Not.
So.
Much.

I got their egg white/turkey sausage flatbread sandwich and a chocolate donut and some hash browns.  My husband got a breakfast wrap, and the kids got donuts and my daughter also got a bagel.

The ""wrap"" that my husband got was the size of his finger and barely edible.  My flatbread didn't taste like anything--no flavor to it whatsoever.  The actual bread was stale and hard :(  And the hasbrowns-BLECH!!!  They were wibbly and overseasoned.  So disgusting.

Well, she was right; it was totally worth the trip. What a cute place! I loved the look of it from the brightly painted outside to the warmly painted cozy inside with hammered copper tabletops. 

The place is pretty small and it was packed when we got there, but were able to snag a free table off in the corner.  I started out with the cafe con chocolate.  I figured a beverage must be pretty spectacular to name a restaurant after it...and it was! A big steamy mug of hot chocolate with a shot of espresso was exactly what I needed. Then came the food.  After what seemed like an eternity I was presented with a big delicious mess of a plate.  The Chilaquiles with mole sauce and scrambled eggs was delectable...and huge.  I sampled my friend's huevos rancheros which was also quite tasty.  We also shared a side of plantains (sweet fried deliciousness topped with cream and cheese) and home fries (perfectly fried and spiced with what I believe was chipotle).  

I was STUFFED by the end of this meal.  Portions are gigantic.  We had to utilize the table next to us for our sides of plantains & home fries because the main dishes took up our whole table.

We went here for a late lunch. Football was on the TV and the place only had a few customers. Our waitress (Tori) had a really bad attitude about everything. Someone in our party made 2 polite, IMHO not unusual/unrealistic requests-- he wanted tomato sauce on a cheese steak and wanted 2 sides-- onion rings and fries. You would have thought we ordered fried golden retriever! Her answer to everything was ""no,"" and then we'd have to cajole her into allowing us to pay extra for an extra side. She overall had a really bad, negative attitude.

The food arrived. She dumped it on the table and vanished, never to be seen. Four times we had to ask someone else to find her so we could get drink refills, napkins, and our check. She was surly and clearly put out by having to come back to the table. 

The food was a mixed bag. The ribs, onion rings, and cheese steak were great. The turkey burger was dry and charred to a crisp. The salad was a cup of lettuce and not much else. 

After waiting forever and getting someone else to find the waitress, we finally paid and left. I called immediately and asked to speak to the manager. I was polite and explained the bad attitude/service. The manager told me she'd speak with the waitress, get ""her side,"" and if the waitress agree-- send us a gift card. I found that answer to be pretty outrageous... I am not sure how the waitress is supposed to have a ""side"" in something like this-- I guess the manager didn't believe me.

This was my first time at a Buffalo Wild Wings. I wanted to watch a period or two of the Flyers game on the tv and eat dinner. Upon arrival, I found the bar to be about half full. I sat down and waited a few minutes before being asked for drink selection. I noticed the people around me having to wave and holler across the bar to try and get the bartenders' attention to either pay their bill or ask for something. There were two bartenders but it appeared one was strictly dealing with drink orders coming from the dining area. I did find the wait for my next drink and food order to be somewhat lengthy, but I refuse to be that person that will yell across a bar. I ordered my sandwich and another drink and only had to wait approximately 10 minutes before its arrival. I did have to walk across the bar to get silverware as the bartender did not give me any. If melded with a few more chicken breasts, my sandwich would've worked perfectly on the left front wheel of my vehicle. Absolutely one of the worst pieces of chicken I've eaten. I had two bites hoping the second one on the other side of the sandwich would be better (it wasn't). I simply threw it in the basket and attempted to get the bartenders attention to get my bill. A game in futility. Finally got my bill, paid, and said my final good bye to Buffalo Wild Wings. Nice knowing ya, kid !",0,mr_aH3MgHw5bn818gu4a2g

I came by on a Tuesday afternoon and was helped out by Ben.  He was fantastic - he let me trial-ride four different bikes so that I could figure out more of what I wanted and listened really carefully to my vague ideas of what I wanted in a bike.  After trying out 3 bikes and giving feedback each time, he found one in the store that was right in my price range and was the exact fit I was looking for.  He even went over the pros and cons of different helmets with me.  I could've felt like an idiot, but Ben made it easy to feel like I could get the hang of this biking thing.  He said to come back for a free tune-up in 30 days to check in about how the bike was riding and encouraged me to come by with any other questions or concerns.

I bought an unlimited class membership for a month and I cannot wait to try out every single class!  They have classes at sunrise (6:30 a.m.) in the middle of the day and at night, so it accommodates every schedule.

The yoga studio is small.  It comfortably fits about 8ish people (there were 6 people including the instructor in the class I took), but it is absolutely gorgeous in a calming way.  I am so glad one wall is completely a mirror so I can see what I look like in the poses (even when it's ridiculous).  Strangely enough there is a kitchen towards the back, but it works in a co op kind of way.  (They sell coconut water, granola, etc. so I guess there is an upside to having a kitchen).

I took Hot Booty Sculpt with Lori Bertoline and it was fantastic!  Before going I wondered if Hot Booty Sculpt meant I was going to get a hot booty or if it was booty sculpt class that was hot (temperature wise).  Really it is both, but the heat of the room is not so hot it is unbearable (like I've read about other hot yoga sessions).  I didn't even really notice it other than I did sweat quite a bit.  It was more a pilates type class than yoga, but boy did I feel it working my glutes.  Best part was the 90s music in the background that kept me going through the tough parts.

Okay. I get it. We waited. 5 servers mind you walking around still getting ready for lunch service. The hostess came over and placed us where we wanted. 

A waiter came to our table and explained the specials and took our drink order.  We ordered the fish special and a soup. The waiter comes back and places our bread on the window ledge. The table was clear and the ledge was over the tale. It was harder to place it on the ledge than it was on the table. My date looked at me and smirked.  The staff is very, should I say, 'to the point' and lacks personality. Except one guy and the only personality he had was was his shaved head with a curly waxed goatee.

There was a huge dance floor on the main level for those that wished to dance, while a large balcony upstairs with many tables for dining accommodated those who wished to enjoy dinner with the concert.  The breaded tenderloin sandwich I ordered was THE GREATEST I have ever had anywhere, and this is even in Indiana, which I consider to be ""tenderloin country""!!!  The tenderloin is huge and freshly fried with simple but wonderful tasting flaky breading.  The bun is big enough to accommodate the entire large tenderloin, and the sandwich goes well with the fresh lettuce, tomato, mayo, and potato chips that come with it.  The tenderloin was so wonderful that I have come here out of my way at least a couple of times and waited around to get at least two at a time to go.  If you love loud and/or live country music and/or would like to dance, plan to stay, but if you want a quiet, subdued dinner environment, plan to do take out.

Something in the kiwi topped roll and the strawberry roll had a bit of an off taste to me; I think maybe the flavoring in the rice.  But still good.

When I went to pick him up the already high price I pay on the regular had increased to $82. I usually pay in the low $70s at SM for the extended amount of services I ask for since my husky is a high shed breed. It's not a big jump but when I asked she tried to tell me it didn't change and I'm paying the same I always have. I let it go and paid. Got my dog. When we went outside he looked nice. He had his bandana like always, looked clean. But when I pet him globs of fur came out. This was a dissapointment. The entire reason I come to this business and pay the high prices is because they've always done a good job at fully brushing him out so he isn't shedding tons of fur.. At least for the day. I understand a husky sheds plenty but they've done just fine in the past making it so his coat stays on him for at least a couple days. Paying a higher rate and then coming home and having to brush him out myself is quite disappointing. I didn't pay $82 to bring him directly home and have to brush him some more. & as a side note he's usually smells fantastic and this time he just smells like a wet dog. Even after he dried. 

A month ago I would tell you to definitely make the trip and shed the extra cash because they are worth it, now I don't know what's going on (new employees? New management? Saving money? What!) but..

Once someone tries one of these melt in your mouth yeast doughnuts, the answer is self evident because this primal instinct takes over, and suddenly doughnuts will start being sucked down the esophagus so fast that a vacuum effect starts almost automatically.

With my haircut for my upcoming wedding on the line, I was nervous to place that responsibility in the hands of a barber I'd never met. I'm very happy with the results. 

The entire experience was positive. First, and though this isn't exactly innovative, I was able to schedule an appointment with a barber of my choosing. The barbers even have Instagram sites, and you can look at their work before you go in. As I said before, though it isn't innovative, this sort of network access made the experience right from the beginning. Chris cut my hair with careful attention to detail. It didn't feel rushed. 

Sidenote: what I don't like about other barber shops is the overwhelming masculinity. I really can't stand going in to other shops and feeling like I have to bro-out. I didn't get that at HiEnd, and I really enjoy the relaxed feel of the shop. 

I trust Chris not only because of the excellent haircut and the efficient service, but also because he is a prosumer of sorts. He described the process of learning to build the cabinets in the shop (that display some memorabilia) from YouTube, and though some might scoff at such a thing, I felt just a little more trusting of Chris. Think of it this way: when you own your first house, one that you worked hard for in advance or went into debt to own, you treat it a lot better than that crappy apartment you rented as a college student. You might clean better, and surprisingly, get pissed when the floor gets scuffed.

If we could give negative stars for an overall rating, Girasole would have gotten MINUS 5.  I am a soft-spoken person who has never felt the need to say something to a manager until my boyfriend and I ate here last Saturday.  

They ran out of two main ingredients (standard ingredients for a mojito) which they neglected to tell us twice when ordering drinks.  

Our waitress did not bring us our entrees - they must have been food runners who brought  them out- nor did she check on us until we were more than half way through our meal so I did not get to tell her that my side dish never came.  No apology until she was walking away.  Keep in mind that it was not busy whatsoever for a Saturday night and the food is absolutely nothing special. 

We have a Chequemate card which GUARANTEES 25% off the bill SEVEN days a week at this restaurant.  They would not take it because it was a Saturday (absolutely wrong because the website says seven days a week) - and the manager berated me with questions as to why I never said anything about my side dish (as if it was my fault that it never came).  She would not do anything for us to compensate.  She was extremely rude (I was totally baffled by her lack of customer service).  She flat out said ""don't leave a tip"" in order to compensate for their mistakes.  For the first time in my life - I did not leave a tip.  The manager can explain why to the waitress.

My favourite dishes in the rotation became the Trout on Monday and the Brisket on Wednesday, pair that with their mash with some au jus, Mac and cheese and greens and you have yourself a very filling, delicious, comforting brunch/lunch. 
You also can't forget to add some of their Banana pudding, Pecan pie or Chess pie..... all three of these made it into my tummy one visit or another.

Starr created an even more Parisian bistro than I've seen in Paris.  It's like you've stepped into a film noire and you're about to meet your garcon.  There is simply a sick amount of detail here--if you appreciate antique tile and lighting, you will love the decor.  It's a mini Bellagio of tile.  

The bathrooms are delightful.  Walk into swinging doors...walk into a marble and honed granite and tile masterpiece.  

Once you get beyond the decor, it's a fantastic place to spend an evening if you're not eating...or if it's a warm, Philadelphia night and you can sit on the sidewalk and take in people watching as pedestrians flow by on Rittenhouse Square.  

It has the rightly earned reputation of being a cougar den.  It should also be noted that men of that 50+ age now readily perch there as well.  Stare at the tile rather than the dressed-20-years-too-young-for-their-age set.  

Most of the bartenders are delightful...there are a few of them that are none too friendly...a few of the women have that ""I'd rather drop dead than acknowledge a woman waiting for a drink at the bar"" attitude but most do not.  They have a grand selection of liquor and the drink concoctions are very good though tend to be more Summer-appropriate.  For the area, the prices really aren't terrible. 

In terms of the food, like I said...it's fine.  It's loud.  I can't imagine trying to eat in there as the acoustics simply aren't set up for the romantic dining such a decor could lend itself to...so do yourself a favor and either commit to light appetizers at the bar or eat somewhere else first.

For everyone that discounts Starr as a higher-class chain restauranter, this certainly defies that notion.  It's definitely raised the bar in Philadelphia.",2,GaKyW6kwBKia6AKxmxBrtQ

While I don't think Azie is as good as Bluefin or the higher quality center city sushi places (Zama, Zento, Morimoto), it is the best sushi option in the immediate area. Probably the only comparable restaurant is Nectar, but Nectar is not a pure sushi restaurant. 

While the fish quality was high, there were a few things that irked me while eating at Azie. The appetizer section of the menu is in desperate need of revision. There was literally nothing that looked interesting. 

Another negative that stood out was the horrible quality of their tap water. We ended up getting a bottle of Pellegrino, because the water was undrinkable. It seemed like a filter needed to be changed. 

Overall, definitely a great addition to the area.",4,MdUimpfJQHijcy1DZu-r4A

This was the case at This Is Hardcore festival this weekend. I've been seeing aggressive live music for almost 20 years, and in that time I've figured out how much room I need, where I need to stand, and how I need to stand. Saturday night, stage right, there was a staff member pushing already tightly packed people closer together, ensuring there wouldn't be enough room to stand with feet spread apart. This is an essential stance when you're being pelted with stage diving bodies. The result was more people falling over (can be deadly), and people being crushed against steel barriers. (Also potentially deadly). It was clear that the staff didn't have anyone's safety in mind, and were only interested in protecting themselves from liability.

We got a snickerdoodle cookie and a Pecan tart.  Both were yummers!!  You can literally taste the freshness!  Neither were too sweet.

Despite having a 9:00 reservation, the first thing we hear from the woman working there is that our wait is going to be at least a half hour. Not an ounce of regret or apology either. She also wrote down our name and seated us in the order in which we came in, which led me to believe they didn't really keep reservations in the first place.  The 30 minute wait turned out to be closer to 50, which wasn't too bad because it was a great night.  One highlight of the wait was when the female manager - who was about the size of a linebacker - came up to all those waiting for a table and barked at them to tell her their names so she can verify where they were on her list.  As soon as she left the patio everyone sort of looked dumbfounded at how an employee could be so rude.  We had some margaritas while waiting which were really subpar. I should have said something when I watched their 'house' margarita come out of a nozzle from behind the bar.   

Although the rude service wouldn't stop me from coming back, especially because their patio is great on a nice summer/spring evening, the food wasn't what I remembered.  Everything seemed a little bland - even the chips and salsa.  We had to put some salt on almost everything that came out.  My enchilada was pretty good, but nothing I'd rush back for.  Someone got a pepper stuffed with pork that just had the oddest taste to it.  It wasn't bad, but definitely wasn't worth ordering.  I did get a kick out of reading an earlier review talking about the sea bass, because leaving the restaurant I commented that I couldn't believe they served several upscale entree items, because with such lackluster basic dishes I had no faith their filet or fishes would have been any good.

Not a bad place to be on a nice night, but rude service and average food.  They really must make all their return business off of their atmosphere.",0,a07k3Sdt1fMfpeYoMiY5UA

It's an oversized dinner plate piled high with greens, grilled chicken, bacon, egg, cheese, and tomatoes.  And they give you a bread side, which once you see the salad, is laughable.  I'd say the $10.29 price tag is more than fair for the amount of food you get.

The seating seems a bit odd, especially, the cave-like two seater areas.  We originally were seated there but it was too claustrophobic and it sounded like we were in a box.  We tried to move to window view seat but those were only for 4 persons, even though it wasn't busy.  Moving to the main dining room presented larger tables but uncomfortable chairs.  Overall, it seems a bit pretentious to me and not exactly a place to relax and have a chill lunch.

My meatball sandwich was rather flavorless but I did like the bread it came in.  For $12+ dollars I find it a bit lacking and kind of insulting.  My girlfriend had the quiche which she couldn't eat because of the puree consistency and awful flavors.   So a quick lunch turned into $40+  easily.  Not exactly a place I want to drop in for a quick & easy lunch.

I've been to Portland, I've been to SF and what I would love to see Santa Barbara embrace is a vegan restaurant that doesn't try to compete on the high-end but provides really good, simple vegan food at a decent price.    At lot of us don't need fancy table settings, $20 entrees and all the LA bistro type settings but a varied, seasonal menu that features local Farmers Market ingredients that you can come back to again and again.

However, when calling them to find out when the car will be ready, into get a breakdown of the bill, they charged me for a brake job that I didn't ask for. To their credit, they took the labor off for the brake job and gave me a reasonable price for the pads. I understand they needed to be changed, so I was willing to accept that. However, after driving the car the noise that I originally brought the car in for was still there. This is after dropping it off and telling them to please check the strut. They said the noise was from the tie rods, changed them, and charged me approximately $600. Now, it turns out the problem is the strut. 

The gentleman I dealt with at the desk, told me they could install the strut at a discount price. I'm not sure what kind of discount is fair since I just paid $600 to have the problem corrected in the first place. Maybe the tie rod was bad, or close to being needed replaced the same as the brakes. But at this point, my wallet doesn't know the difference. All I know is, I'm out $600 for something that wasn't corrected.

With that said, I compared the discount price they offered me to put new struts in, and it turned out to be the same price everybody else was giving me including labor.
 I find this to be a shame because the people were so nice and the reviews prior to mine were mixed.

I thought about a month  before posting this review. I really wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, to be sure they installed either the correct or the incorrect part. When I got under my car, the answer was obvious. The strut was bad, no doubt about it.

 I wish them well, and better luck in the future. 

After reading the business owners response, I can only encourage him to read the rest of the reviews of his business. Of course I didn't bring the car back in. I decided not to gamble the rest of my money with this business. I'm sure the owner of the business was aggravated because he spent money on a part that had no value. Or, that would bring him no profit. That's exactly how I felt. And as far as having no problem with the strut, then yes if a torn Boot and oil leaking out of the strut is no problem, then yes it was no problem with it. I acknowledge the fact that you changed the brake pads with no labor charge. Perhaps next time you should ask before you start changing parts. We talked about the brakes before you did the work, and I told you I was going to do it myself. If you look at the other reviews, you'll see that that is not the first time that happened.

I truly wish you well.",0,dePpgSv5kEvhCMa7j1gXkQ

It's a nice combination of a burger/sandwich joint and other pub fare with a casual upscale feel.

In keeping with its name, you'll find burgers with names like The Class Act, The Critic and The Drama Queen. I went with The Director... cuz, ya know, I like to be in charge ;). The Director comes with avocado, jack cheese and stewed green chillies. Fries are included, but you can substitute soup or a salad for a dollar extra. Personally, I'm not a fan of the extra dollar for substitution, especially when the burger's already going for $14. Why not just offer it all up as side choices from the get go? Anyway, it's a minor pet peeve. I went the extra dollar and got the soup of the day, butternut squash soup. It came with a lovely little cream pattern on the top. It was so pretty... like a soup barrista made it or something.

While in Edmonton, it's only appropriate I have at least a pint of Edmonton beer. I started out with a seasonal selection of Alley Kat, followed up with a pint of Deschutes... a rather tasting beer out of Portland.

Sushi ""chefs"" don't even greet the customers! Maybe because we're Asian and they are too, they think it's OK? Tried the tempura and it was just OK because the batter was not that crisp. Sushi rolls were tasty and pretty, rice was cooked correctly. The sunomono was good.

Our reservation was at 9pm and we ended up being the last ones in the restaurant but never felt rushed by any of the employees, which I appreciate more than they know having worked in the industry. The service was so wonderful! Our server and other servers were very attentive. The food was fast and delicious. We ordered the cornmeal fries and fried pickles to start. The apps didn't blow me away but the watermelon heirloom tomato salad made up for it. So fresh and delicious! Their signature burger was so darn good, I still reminisce of those flavors that I have never experienced in a burger before! The kitchen also prepared the duck and waffles, which they didn't have on the menu that night (but we saw it online), and the chicken three ways. Everything was so fresh and amazing!

Or, if you don't care about the curry puffs, come after Noon.  It slowed down to almost no lines and most of the food was still there at about Noon.  The curry puffs run out fast, I have no idea why. But if you don't care about them and don't want to stand in endless lines, I'd suggest coming after the rush.  

I specifically went there because after having chicken curry puffs in California at an Indian restaurant, I have checked out any hint that some place was making them.  If anyone knows a place that is making curry puffs, mild to hot, chicken curry minced and mixed with a small amount of finely chopped potatoes in a puff pastry, please let me know.  

My first mistake was buying a bunch of them instead of one, waste of money on the rest.  It had sugar as one of its top two ingredients.  The curry puffs had the barest scent of curry, no curry flavor, a crap load of sugar, a lot of potatoes and a hint of chicken.  If you like that, you'll love these.

The soup which was raved about here is a 5 spice broth with copious amounts of sugar.  I don't get it, Thai food can have some sweet dishes but this was awful.  I got the beef and it was tough and coated with the congealed blood from being boiled and not properly skimmed.  I could go on, but if you like candied soup, you'll love this.

Meat on a stick.  The beef was my favorite and from several conversations I overheard, the most popular.  It's not that it was great, it was good, but compared to the chicken (sold down by the flower stand) and the pork, it was the best.   

The chicken on a stick is dyed red (you all know that red dye is bad, right?), unseasoned and just kind of there.  The pork was all yellow hopefully from turmeric and not dye (it looked like chicken satay usually does) and was decent.  If they hadn't told me it was pork, I would have thought it was chicken and it was way better than the actual chicken was.

Sausage was really good.  If you don't get it by now, I'm picky.  Those sausages were the best of what I had there and I am not a major fan of sausages of any kind.  I bought them on a whim to get a complete sample and it was a good thing I did.  They were delicately but nicely flavored.  You could taste the spices, but they didn't overwhelm.  To be clear, it had spices, but not hot spices, so don't worry about it being hard to handle.

Fried bananas, sweet potatoes and taro.  The bananas were not ripe so they were bland.  If they had been ripe, with the fried coating, I expect they would have been a treat.  Under-ripe, they weren't good.  The sweet potato was under-cooked so, yeah, not good.  They need to partially cook the sweet potato to bring out the flavor and they obviously don't.  The taro was tasteless.",0,T7Pa4ADJrux8fSYH3Mv9rA

Clearly, the food is above average, but for the price it should be.  When a veal entrée is $39.50 and a seafood pasta, $54.00, everything must be spectacular.  So let's dissect Kemoll's.

The menu changes at 6 from expensive to pretty much astronomical pricing.

My wife had Veal Marsala, and I had Veal Milanese.  Both were large pounded thin slices of veal very well cooked.  My Mianese, had too much butter/olive oil sauce and the lemon overtones were pretty powerful, especially on the canned artichoke heart slices.  Not overpowering, but bordering on it.

We had 2 crab cakes as starters, and while they were a bit overdone, the remoulade sauce was spicy and really quite nice.  I would have thought for $16.00 we could discern the taste of crab.

Apparently, the restaurant was busy, it took almost an hour to be served our entrée.  The waiter was not overly hovering, but was attentive and quite apologetic, apparently there was a large party slowing the kitchen down.  Where the party was, was mysterious since the dining room was not crowded.

Desert was magnificent, and the view from the 40th floor looking at the Arch and the Musial Bridge was spectacular.

My only real complaint is the parking situation. A few weeks ago my car was towed from our parking lot and had my parking pass hanging, I was not happy. I was told by a girl at the office that the tow company just comes and randomly tows whenever they want, which the tow company laughed at and said absolutely not and that someone from the office called for them to come and signed for every  single car taken. I was on a curb (not blocking anyone), along with several other cars, because ALL of the spots were taken (they almost always are full past 8 and I often work late). A lot of people that don't live there and don't have parking passes have codes to get in and leave us without parking spots. If they either had assigned parking or towed only the people that don't pay to live there I think this problem would be solved. Me and other people that live there have to park out on the road  all the time and we pay way too much for that to happen. But other than this, it has been a great place to live.

The gal who helped me explained the consignment process and accepted my in season items and jewelry.  She also let me know that I had access to an online account that would show me the prices of my pieces and when my items sold.  I'm not always out on that side of town, so I am thankful that there is an online system for me to check my account!  

If you are a fellow lover of all things quality and resale, I HIGHLY suggest you stop by La Bella and check out their collection!  (Beeline it to the jewelry counter, their sterling case is AMAZING!)

Thanks La Bella!!!",0,ekMSvtUCpRf3FwS_XWV3Rg

I would give them 5 stars for keeping the farm looking nice and it being in one family for so long. And I would give them 5 stars for the ice cream if it was all natural and didn't contain all the ingredients to keep the ice cream smooth and extend its shelf life. And it isn't cheap ice cream so why it has a single $ is baffling. It is about the most expensive premium ice cream you could buy and costs about $5 for a small serving.

So my rating averages out to 4 stars. 5 stars for the farm and 3 star for the ice cream which I would easily give 5 stars if they removed the antifreeze. It is a shame that they use their own cream from cows they treat so well and have such a friendly staff and then add all those unneeded ingredients. But if there were ice crystals in the ice cream people would complain that it isn't smooth enough, so in a way they have to add them, but it is a shame they can't make it all natural. People want the best of both worlds. I think of organic food like an apple. If it has chemicals, its bad. But if it has worms and doesn't look perfect, its bad and people won't buy it. But we are talking about ice cream, its not health food, so you will have problems from the fat before the small amount of chemicals cause any health problems. They are the same chemicals found in water ice.

And I wish they would sell their own milk. I would be there way more often if they had something to offer besides ice cream, fudge, and cheese. But this is a nice, quiet place to take the kids and relax.",2,rEwVvbb5iGSbZWsIQxeLOw

My biggest complaint is that their food is too good. I don't want to order anything else because the Drunken Noodles and Cashew Chicken are both so delicious that it seems like a waste to come here and try anything else.

We mostly use Siam Square as a takeout restaurant. It's worth noting that they do a great job packaging their food. When I ordered Sweet and Sour chicken they were conscientious enough to put the vegetables and sauce in a separate container from the deep fried chicken so it wouldn't get soggy (and obviously the rice was packaged separately from both of those containers).

To start we received complimentary soup, a glass of Mango juice or lemon juice or pop iirc (used to be a jug based on previous reviews) & a jug of chilled water. The vegetable noodle soup was very flavourful and was great start to the meal. Reading older reviews a salad was previously also included but times change I guess. 

Our group of 3 each ordered different combos (rice & beef safari, pasta carysan with camel and Alfredo pasta with BBQ chicken) and were pleasantly surprised on the speed of service, quality and amount of food we received. Everything arrived quickly  and at once. Missing however was the vegetable of the day, instead the first main dish contained a bit of frozen veggies as garnish.. . 

Every dish was perfectly seasoned and cooked. There is however a $5 extra charge for camel meat but it was beautifully cooked & melt in your mouth tender. 

Despite the cutbacks and various changes I still highly recommend trying this place. For $15, there is still great value in what you get compared to other places ex) complimentary soup, juice, 1 pasta entrée and 1 meat entree.",1,J9Cf05G0ccxYMjBdC6s3gQ

My review has to do with their mission. This establishment does not support the eradication of hunger; it stands for the spiritual extortion and destruction of ancient cultures. The organization that ""fights"" hunger in this case is King's Castle Ministries, a missionary group focused on remote areas in El Salvador and Nicaragua. These remote locations are still largely ignorant of Christianity, and therefore the people there have not been exposed to infectious ideas like inherent guilt, low-self worth, sin, and eternal hellfire. King's Castle goes there and holds those innocent people ransom for aid and assistance until they accept those toxic ideas and convert to Christianity. In the process, King's Castle seeks to destroy traditional religions that these Central American still practice and their native culture.

The audacity of imperialism and superiority that King's Castle demonstrates in the 21st century is shocking and morally reprehensible. Why are burger joints engaging in the support of spiritual extortion and cultural destruction in this day and age? Why are cheeseburgers being used as tools to further a depraved agenda?

Please do no support Hunger Burger and instead support secular organizations which will deliver aid to impoverished people without the pretense, judgment, and ill will.",4,LORN3NiyFRqjeLAIGtEiYA

Saturday morning and decided to try this place i've driven past for years. During a prime time 8:45/9am this place was dead for breakfast (my regular place is mobed by then). 

The girl at the bagle ordering station was plesently Saturday morning friendly, no salt bagles? what?! ok i ordered 6 bagles to go and got some cream cheeses from the cooler. At the register the Manager (nasty grimising woman) gives me this weird, im in a hurry, ""how are you is that it?!"" I said yes thank you, she said the price and then extended her arm holding her hand out like a begger demanding money? WTF?! it took me a sec to get my wallet out and the credit card - she held her hand out there the whole time. Her facial expression was condesending like i caused her harm or something.

As i moved my credit card toward her hand she extended further and snached it. What a truly ill mannored untrained nasty woman (and she's the manager). no wonder the place is DEAD.

ok, but how about the bagles: a bit dense and chewy - flavor was good. 
my regular spot a garlic bagle has garlic on all sides, this place only on the top - cheap and greedy - really scrimping pennies to make a profit? 

the spreads were  salmon  and veggie creamcheese. Other (real begal) stores actually make these spreads on site with lox or nova from their deli, this place is a chain store so its factory made pre-packaged. Pricy too! The Salmon tasted like salmon but there are no peices of salmon to be found, its not pink in color, so I have no idea how they made it taste like salmon - scary right. Veggie was the same - really dense and hard to spread creamcheese - but it does taste as marketed.

Will I go back? 90% NO, but if I was really in a pinch for a bagel and a place to sit down with no other option - begrudgingly ya I'd go :0(",3,vRN6kEeGg5dogoq3aqJgrA

The atmosphere and menu are definitely different from the original location, but it's really refreshing to see Caje experimenting with their options. 

I had a really positive first few visits here, and I expect that this place will become quite popular in the coming months. They use their own beans, roasted at the IV location. They had previously used Handlebar coffee, but I personally like the Caje beans better.

Unlike the IV location, this one serves a menu of more exotic, cosmopolitan coffee and tea-based drinks. Many of them appear like cocktails and their prices reflect that. I would say that you should go for the Burnout if you like a less-sweet latte drink. The Yemen is also good, but it is more similar to a mocha and hence a bit sweeter. The Burnout has a bit of a ginger spice to it, but it's not overwhelming. 

Finally, the simple coffee drinks are also solid, although the espresso varies depending on who is pulling it. I'm overall very excited to see how this place evolves and develops its menu! What an amazing addition to downtown Santa Barbara.",1,7-lxQafF7BuscqnCwWcl6g

I dreamed about my meal last night and can't wait until I can go back again! I've been craving good Korean food ever since I got back home for the summer and this place did not disappoint. Seoul Garden is hands-down the place to go get your fix! Thanks to all the Yelpers that helped me find this place. It definitely met and exceeded my expectations.

I came here to celebrate a birthday in the family - there were about 5 of us all together. When we arrived, which was around 6ish, it was pretty empty. I think there was one other table there, but that was fine - more attention for us, lol. We were quickly greeted by the hostess who was super friendly and guided us to our table, gave us menus and took our drink orders. We all decided to go with the all-u-can-eat Korean BBQ special. For only $20, it's an awesome deal, well worth the money, so come hungry! In addition to the unlimited grilled meats, you get banchan, or Korean side dishes, as well as the table's choice of two soups.

A few moments after ordering, a server brought a large grill to our table. There are six various meats to choose from which are pork belly/korean brisket, chicken/beef bulgogi, sirloin steak, seasoned premium cut, marinated spicy pork, and spicy chicken - so technically 8 choices. They were out of the sirloin steak today, but our server told us that the seasoned premium cut was very similar. We started out with the seasoned premium cut first. The servers were so kind and helped us cook the meat and were very attentive. Along with the platter of raw meat came with a wide array of banchan, which filled our table. Some of the items that I remember were fried tofu, marinated bean sprouts, lotus root, potato salad, battered zucchini, veggies with sweet chili sauce, daikon radishes, fish cakes, steamed egg and of course, kimchee! Then, came our bubbling hot soups, which were spicy chicken (bone-in chicken with potato - yum!) and tofu soup (silky tofu with beef and seafood - delish!). Oh, and by the way, the meals all come with rice and a sesame dipping sauce. You can also get unlimited refills on all the banchan and rice - just ask the servers!

We tried almost all of the meat offerings, but found the seasoned premium cut and beef bulgogi to be my favorite! The seasoned premium cut was so succulent and flavorful. Make sure you don't overcook it or the meat will be tough and not juicy and tender. The beef bulgogi was a bit sweet, but mixed with the rice and other side dishes, was really well balanced. My favorite side dishes were the battered zucchini, steamed egg and the potato salad. Both soups were amazing. I think next time, I'll try the rice cake soup.

I ended up eating my weight in delicious food, but I was oh so satisfied! Seoul Garden is a bit out of the way from other big eating areas (the loop, university city, etc), but it is well worth the trip for some delicious food! The service here is absolutely impeccable - our servers were friendly and kept a good eye on us in terms of refilling your drinks, getting more side dishes or asking what meat we'd like next. They also did a great job answering any questions we had about our meal. I had an incredible experience and will be back soon! If you haven't been, I HIGHLY recommend trying it out.

I attended a small, planned celebration in their bar area, and where they put our party was not the best idea. It was alongside both the bar and windows, at three high top tables. The physical location was terrible, because it was right in the way of people trying to get to the 
restrooms. Poor planning on their part. Once this get together was over, a couple of us decided to stay and talk and have cocktails. Even though it was a Tuesday night the bar area was sort of full, though bar tables were open, (the actual seats at the bar were all taken.) This presented us with some difficulty in getting our refreshments. I would not, however, say it was due to any other reason except lack of response from their bartenders. If it hadn't been for a random stranger that knew the bartenders, I think we would have had to wait another five or so minutes for attention. And this sort of lack of bartender attention continued for the duration of our visit, and we are an attractive group that tip well! So when we were finally able to order, our first round of two glasses of wine, one chardonnay, one pinot grigio, it was a reasonable $12. Later, when another friend joined us, I ordered the same two glasses of wine, along with a Key lime pie martini, this time the total was $28. I don't understand why the jump, and didn't notice at first or I would have probably asked why a martini should cost $16. (And it wasn't even tasty) I mean $16 dollars, that is like a dollar a sip for ""bar well"", no name, alcohol.

I was excited to hear such good stuff about this place, being a new Philly transplant from NYC.  Went with the kids and got a half-dozen, mixed, to try out the gamut.  $3 each?  A little steep, no?  Well, for good cakes, I figured it would be worth it.

Unfortunately, they weren't.  I don't know who likes cupcakes like this, but it ain't me.  They were dry, crumbly and light -- I almost can describe them as ""ash-like"" in consistency.  Tiny crumbs flaking everywhere.  The icings were decent, but that doesn't make up for the cake itself.  The chocolate cake and the pound cakes were like this...  Almost crumbling to dust before you could eat them.  Our cupcake-crazed toddler didn't even want to finish hers.  Unheard of!

On the positive side, the red velvet cupcakes were OK.  They had a little more moistness, a little more body, and didn't dissolve under your touch.

The taste of the cakes themselves weren't bad, the size was good, and you could tell that the ingredients were decent (hence the two stars).  Maybe I'm just used to a different kind of cake, but Sugar Sweet Sunshine and Buttercup in NYC are cheaper and infinitely better in my book.  I'm disappointed.",2,A7Uw9Piay95fIcCdCe6Puw

The poutine is good, but that's really the only think I'd recommend 100%.

A majority of the exhibit was according to the states. There were also some exhibits about specific foods and drinks. The exhibits were informative, but lacked some pizzazz. It was a little on the boring side to read about food and drinks without being able to try some of food or drinks. Like looking at cookies, but not being able to eat one.

update: the owner responded to my original post, sounds like part of this was employee error (or poor training) considering I just asked for a side of fries with the order. What he failed address is the fact that I was charged more for the lamb pita than the posted price. His employee was apparently aware of that disparity as she seemed unphased when I pointed it out.

Jim and Ken do the selling.  I have yet to stump them on technical issues with the bikes or their knowledge of the competitors' offerings.  They are honest, professional and hardworking.

James runs the shop.  I have had same day service and honest advice EVERY time.  In the end, I trust my life to my motorcycle which means I trust my life to James and his excellent mechanics, Grant and Marcus.  My trust and faith have been rewarded and well placed.

Travis runs the parts area.  He has personally investigated almost everything in the shop or online.  His first answer is always: ""Let me try to help with that.""  Travis knows the best protective gear.  He knows how to fix, clean and program EVERYTHING.

With some amusement, I have read the one star reviews below.  They have ZERO relationship to reality.  

One guy goes to a MOTORCYCLE dealership to buy a wholesale Mercedes SEDAN from a guy, Dave Sirkow (whom I have met), who has NO RELATIONSHIP to the business.  Dave is a car wholesaler.  How do I know?  I sold him a used Corvette to buy a new K1600GTL motorcycle.  My dealings with Dave were pleasant, but I always knew that Dave had nothing to do with Iron Horse.  Also, the reviewer's Yelp page has SEVENTEEN one-star reviews (out of 20).  I think this guy's entire Yelp life is spent running small businesses into the ground.  He's a California malcontent who doesn't care about being fair to a non-party to his car deal.  Ridiculous.

Another one-star review deals with an ABS issue with an older BMW that had never been properly maintained.  The older BMWs (pre-2000) were known to have sensitive ABS systems that would fail if you were a cheap bastard and did not maintain them properly.  Look: that failure is not the mechanics' fault.  It's like eating fast food your whole life, having a heart attack and then blaming the cardiologist for informing you that your diet caused the heart damage.  Get real!

The people who blame bad batteries and oil leaks on Iron Horse are the same.  The tone of their reviews tells you what kind of people they are.  Would you want these malcontents in your house or business?  Calling you a terrorist?  Again, get real!  

If you can't get along with John, Jim, Ken, James or Travis, the problem is with YOU, not the business.  These guys bend over backwards for everybody.  And I mean everybody.  Jim does not lose his cool and tell people to ""get the f_ck off our property.""  This is not Walmart.  If you are too stupid and confrontational to be civil in a BMW motorcycle dealership, go somewhere else.  The regular customers--the thousands of happy Iron Horse customers in the Tucson community--would rather not see your rude behavior.  We come here to bond over motorcycles and get help, not witness your poor manners and anger management problems.  Thankfully, I've never witnessed anything like that.

Let's end this review on a positive note (instead of dealing with the stupid one-stars below).  If you want the best deal on a BMW motorcycle, you won't find a better place than Iron Horse.  If you want perfect and professional maintenance, go to Iron Horse.  If you want the right helmet, gloves, boots, etc., go to Iron Horse.  I promise you that you will leave happy and return, again and again, to buy your next machine.  Because...customer service matters, and Iron Horse has that nailed down.

Peace!

What can I say - she (Jenn @ Glow) does TOP NOTCH QUALITY work!!!  My girlfriend has been getting waxed for years, but is relatively new to Santa Barbara and hasn't clicked w/ anyone PRIOR to Jenn.

Bottom line:
-She (my girlfriend) was VERY pleased and felt very comfortable.
-Jenn has over 17 yrs of experience (she said.)
-Jenn was very accommodating w/ me in trying to set up the surprise up (as I was traveling) - totally cool and easy!!
-I was ecstatic - (more later!)
-I was traveling, got a good vibe from Jenn, booked this as a gift (on a good gut feel) and it paid off. In spades!
-This was my girlfriend's experience with this - (I gave it about a 5% chance of going through - figured it would be the standard Brow & Bikini wax (great lesson for me to ""let go"" and see what happens.)
-To the guys and girls - Jenn is very nice, totally professional, accommodating, and I'm told by my girlfriend ""she is quick and really good""
-apparently this is the best she's had in SB and one of the best yet in her years of experience
-lastly - my girlfriend is a fan now and will probably stick w/ that moving fwd.

~~ give her a try - a win win for everyone...

My standards aren't all that stringent; just looking for something that doesn't taste as burnt as all that Seattle chain seems to crank out. Score one for the Mild. It was indeed mild, very mild (but not too mild, mind you, let's not get crazy).

As I wasn't man enough to try the Bold on this fair winter's morn, the Mild did the trick: smoky with hits of cinnamon and berry, and overtones of oak and chocolate. 

Now that I've exhausted all my drink adjectives, I'll admit that perhaps those flavors are there, but the main thing to remember? It is mild.

The chocolate Oreo Bing is definitely worth a try. I really like the consistency of the chocolate bing and the flavour because it isn't super sweet. Also it's a nice surprise when you get to the bottom and find nesquik cereal. They have oreo cookie crumbs scattered throughout the bing but I think it would taste even better if they crushed real Oreos with the cream filling instead.

My boyfriend also really enjoys the cafe affogato, that's the only thing he'll order when we go. 

I've also tried the green tea, mango and strawberry bing and they were ok. Since the mangos are seasonal, some of them weren't very good.  The 2 fruit bings also had dried coconut sprinkled on the top which I wasn't a fan of. I thought I was eating plastic at first. I've also had the green tea latte and though that it was nothing special. I think Starbucks green tea lattes tasted better. 

But if you are out on the south side looking for a dessert place, I would recommend Let Eat Snow. It's usually not super busy and you can usually find a table (I've gone on weekends and weekdays lunch time and evenings and haven't had issues finding a table)",0,fLkGgp_P-VKmu994HlAo3Q

Lobby- large and spacious, good hotel bar/lounge area with plenty of tvs and seating.

Room- room is on the smaller side, but still doable.  No mini-fridge, which is a big con.  Bathroom is really small and outdated (peeling wallpaper, rusty corners, door needs paint).  Biggest plus is the shower head- strong and plentiful water pressure and no wait for hot water!  Towels are badly needing to be replaced- so thin and scratchy they actually hurt my skin when rubbed on them!  Bed is too soft and pillows are too soft/old.  

BUT, my biggest problem of all, was that the entire time, the room smelled like smoke and mildew!!!!!!  It was as if the room had been a smoking room for 50 years... and then converted to a ""nonsmoking"" room without replacing the curtains/wallpaper/sheets/carpeting!  Very humid, basement-like smell.... it seeped into all of my clothes, even the clean ones smelled like the room when I came home and had to be washed!  Not sure if I will be back, even with the great location and friendly staff.....unless they do some serious renovations in their rooms!",1,3ymyVHTDmxbaKNfOe8xgjw

Despite the kitchen looking well staffed and the restaurant not being overwhelmingly busy, we waited over a half hour for our food (counting the time from the order being placed to when we had the food brought out). We saw servers literally lined up waiting for their orders to come, but the kitchen was moving SO slow. This alone was not a big deal, as I understand things happen. 

When we finally got the food, it was cold. Out of three dishes, two felt barely warm and the other was just completely cold to the touch. We asked to speak to a manager and he was unapologetic & rude. He offered to reheat salmon by ""popping it in the microwave."" We asked for a new dish all together and he did not even follow up with our table to make sure everything worked out. I also had a sausage Mac & Cheese dish that was disgusting. I am not picky when it comes to food and will often eat whatever, but I literally could not take more than two bites of the dish. I immediately felt like the food did not settle well and wanted to throw up. I ended up being sick for a good portion of the evening when I got home. This was not just ""it tasted gross"" sick, but ""I ate something horrible/with food poisoning"" sick. 

The manager also did not comp us anything for the horrible experience. Our server used her personal coupons for the establishment to give us a discount off the total bill. She was very apologetic and nice throughout the evening. She also seemed scared of the manager, because she was afraid to ask him to visit the table again to take anything off our bill/address the awful Mac & Cheese dish. My family felt really bad for her. 

I would not recommend this place to anyone, due to the awful food and rudeness of the manager. I also felt like the manager was just as rude to his employees as he was to us, because our server was not the only person who seemed to avoid him as much as possible. I would also not recommend this place due to the visible hostile working environment created by the manager. 

This experience was a few weeks ago. I did not want to post the review the night of, to protect the server in question. The issues all stemmed from the kitchen staff/manager.",3,kY1HuPNJME82x-p7c1n7xQ

I recommend going in a group of at least 4.  Both for the enjoyment piece and pricing.  A bay costs $25-45 per hour depending on what time you go.  I believe it was $25 before noon, $35 noon-5pm, and $45 after 5pm.  But the price is the same regardless of how many of you are using the bay.  So it's can be an expensive date or a pretty cheap split between a group of friends!

Pros: Variety of game types keep the play interesting.  Good upscale pub food and drink selection.  No need to bring any clubs, good selection of Men's and Women's clubs at each bay.

Cons:  I have never had very good service on a visit.  When my wife and I went at noon today, we were playing for 20 minutes before anyone came by our bay to take a drink order.

All of a sudden I get a billed emailed to me on February 7th that said the statement date was January 11th and it was due February 15th.

In 2018, we decided on CMA Fest as nearly every artist shows up at some venue during the festival. We had a great time, but it was a bit different than what we expected. 

We had tickets to the evening performances, which are held at Nissan Stadium. So it's a 30+ min stadium concerts for each performer. However, they were also filming for the CMA special, which got a bit tiresome after awhile when they needed to record intros multiple times. 

During the day there are multiple stages and artists performing on a first come first serve basis or based on a lottery. This are free to attend which is great for fans, but I honestly thought my purchased ticket would get me some privileges, and it did not. Honestly, that was a bit annoying. I understand making it accessible to all, but standing in a huge line to 'maybe' get in is not my thing, so we just stopped going and spent the days at the Honky Tonks on Broadway instead. Still fun, but then I don't have to be in Nashville during the CMA Fest. 

The one really cool thing which we discovered was a small stage inside the Convention Center (which was a ticketed entry area) that showcased new and upcoming artists. This was great fun and got us a bit of a taste of not just the big stars, but the writers and new artists.

I had looked at the online menu several times and knew they had a shrimp po-boy for lunch.  I specifically came here just for that.  I was not disappointed.  It did remind me of when I lived in New Orleans for over two decades.  The French bread was very fresh.  I prefer the tails of the shrimp pinched off but the cornmeal breading was light and tasty. 

However, I also ordered a side of gumbo ($2 extra ) and the horseradish overwhelmed it so much I could not eat it.  If you are reading this managers, authentic creole cooking has no hot spices. Bottles of hot sauce are placed on the table (there were none at this establishment) so the customers can spice up a dish to their liking.  Making something automatically spicy excludes a portion of your customers so that they cannot enjoy these menu selections. 

My wife ordered the World's Crispiest Fish n Chips.  Her plate came full of seasoned fries with a crispy fish filet placed nicely on top.  Since they advertise that the fish is the crispiest in the world, she was anxious to put it to the test.  Her fish was light, crispy and she could tell it was freshly out of the fryer.  The tarter sauce served with it appeared to be homemade and matched up to the fish perfectly.  The fries were the standard fare but she is not really a fan of seasoned fries so you may enjoy them more than she did.

A pot was hung over the fire, on an arm that would swing out with it was dinnertime.  Don't ask my why, of all things, how colonists cooked their food was the only thing I remember learning in 3rd grade.  Maybe also multiplication.

The room was just a bit too dark, which was a bit awkward.  Our waiter and his little assistant were polite and competent, and didn't make fun of my mother for ordering a pina colada at a colonial inn in the dead of winter (the rest of us did, however).

For the starter I ordered the smoked salmon, which came topped with a frisse salad and some crunchy bits.  The salmon was good, but every few bites came with an overpowering pepper flavor, possibly from the salad.  My mom and sister both loved their foie gras, and my dad enjoyed the seared scallops.

For the main entree I had the filet mignon (medium), while my parents got the giant meat entree for two (I forget the cut of steak), and my sister had the crab crepe.  

I ended up trading with my dad.  He found his steak flavorless, while I found the filet mignon tough.  His steak was flavorless, but was saved by a good bernaise sauce.   The accompaniments were good, but I think I've been too spoiled by fresh California produce to be impressed.

She replied that it has cinnamon and savory seasoning on it. A bit skeptical after my whole Rooster incident (see that review on the breakfast potatoes ), I ordered them after she reassured me that it was a popular side and really good! And she was right. Between my tzatiki and i believe apricot ketchup dipping sauce, my palette was extremely satisfied.

Strap yourselves in and brace for impact because it's about to get messier than a toddler eating chocolate pudding during a bout of violent turbulence on their first flight to Disneyland.

Let's start by saying Harp & Crown is a modern dining experience. Keyword - experience.  The food industry is a fickle, competitive and over-saturated area of expertise full of fright and failure, and this restaurant group has proficiently held it's own in various markets for a number of years.  Running a successful dining enterprise is no longer a simple, two-dimensional endeavor of just food and/or service, but nowadays atmosphere plays more important of a role than ever.  Philly, although one of the best food cities in the country, is sadly a few steps behind the times and trends of other cutting edge scenes in burgeoning markets. It is catching up, however, but it still has a long way to go.

That being said, this place is awesome and I love it.  I've been in the service industry now approaching two decades, and I'm probably more comfortable in a restaurant than my own living room.  I find the dining room here open and inviting, with the menu even more enticing than the details of service and decor, and beverage options always intriguing.  Their happy hours are great, and their weekend brunch buffet is such an out of this world value I will often go twice a weekend, because I'm a fatty and never ashamed of a good binge.

Atop the great menu, great drinks, and cool room, it's a see-and-be-seen kind of vibe.  You can bump into some local celebrities (or local snoots, whatever you want to call some of them) but more importantly you can bump into more similar minded people that love and appreciate a good, tasteful time.

I spend a fair amount of time and money there, and will absolutely continue to do so. I highly recommend it and love how this place, and other new spots like it, are pushing the Philly restaurant scene into a more detailed and social direction.  

If only they had a cool dj playing authentic soul, disco, and jazz, I think I would never leave.",0,U7NkC-0oMv4-mHAZOowECw

I have been a customer at the Wilmot store for about 2 years. I generally get good service, and have recently started a rather complex color process involving highlights, and more.  I wanted the same stylist as usual, and made an online appointment asking for her. She was really busy, and called to tell me times she was available and at which store over the next few days.  I went to the  2 other locations where she was supposed to be working, at the appropriate time, after calling each to put my name on the list, as they do not all have the online check in. Over 2 days, I never was able to get a cut and color from any stylist, not just my original choice. It seems the online check in service leaves a great deal to be desired. The last one, Wilmot, (this afternoon) claimed to have 4 stylists and zero wait time in the online program. I went over, found 2 stylists, one of which was not authorized to do color (but she did not tell me this for about 20 minutes.) The other two stylists were on their lunch break --not reflected online,  and why send 2 at once?  At each store I was assured I would be helped very soon ---""in a few minutes"", ""just 10 minutes at the most"" I spent about 2 hours driving to, and waiting at the 3 salons waiting for someone to help me, in addition to rearranging my days to accommodate the stylist!

I have not been here in YEARS almost 10 years.. which says a lot because for 10 years people have been saying it's a good place to eat................. I remember why I hadn't been back in years 20 mins into the dining experience.

We ordered our drinks; wait sorry I ordered my drink coz I needed a Stiff drink ASAP. I got the 'Oh La la Lemonade(vodka inside) with a shot of Chambord'... My lemonade appeared 10 minutes later.. again my lemonade because I tasted absolutely NO vodka for my $9 drink and had no shot either. I should have stopped there and said ok let's go after drinks but I was starving. Hubs ordered the Whiskey Flight and it took a whole 40 minutes to get and the pours looked so puny in sample beer glasses... Lord just put it in shot glasses to be more appealing.

Food. I ordered ribs and he ordered a steak...he specifically ordered the 'bigger steak' and she repeated it 2xs... We got the food before the whiskey flight... YES 40 minutes LATER our waitress was too busy playing in the (open) kitchen and I saw all the 'bartenders' cleaning glasses.. HELLO where was our flight it isn't that hard! Back on track... his steak came but it was the TINIEST steak ever.. when we asked the expediter if this was the large steak- to which he said 'Definitely NOT'- he quickly grabbed the plate apologized and went back to the kitchen. it took another 20 minutes and my food was on the table.. I was raised to wait to eat until everyone had their food but almost 1 hour! 

Food was meh nothing to write home about or say 'HEY Let's go eat there!'. I suppose if the service was better and we were actually checked on instead of avoided the whole experience would have been better.. needless to say.. WHY IS THIS PLACE STILL existing! Because American's love their chains and unfortunately, that's slim pickings for a busy mommy...

I mean, why would I order three different dishes that taste exactly the same?  I couldn't believe that they used the same sauce over and over.

Tokyo Steak House is nestled within a strip mall next to a Blockbuster. Walking in, you'll probably notice the old Polaroid pictures taped to the walls within the lobby, their unaccompanied bar, a funky distinct smell, and a karaoke machine to the side waiting for a brave soul. There are probably 5-6 hibachi tables and half were unused and covered. The only server there was a older petite Japanese woman who found herself shuffling between refilling drinks and bussing tables. 

Onto food... I ordered the filet mignon & shrimp dinner special for $18.95 that included fried rice, stir fried veggies, and noodles - you know, the usual. Not bad at all...considering that the other combo plates were $25+! Yikes! Food was kinda blehhh, and as other Yelpers have stated, garlic seems to be the main ingredient. I can probably go on and on about what the food should have tasted like, but this is their way of preparation and I respect that. However, our chef was entertaining and so was the other staff.

Pluses:  They have both a light emitting shade and a blackout shade which really helps to blockout the street lights so you can get a good nights sleep.  There are lots of plugs in the room including some by the bed so you can plug in cell phones and other devices. Nice flatscreen 42"" TV equipped with plugs to hook devices up to it. High speed internet (both that you can plug directly in and Wi-fi).  Iron/Ironing board. small Safe for valuables in the room (free to use). Room is clean and modern.  They provide toothpaste in addition to the complimentary shampoo/conditioner and there is a list provided of many other freebies (shower cap, lotion, etc that you can ask for).  Hair dryer in room and you can even ask to borrow straight iron or curling iron which is nice. Bed is firm but comfortable.  Convenient to convention center and .6 miles from French Quarter so you can easily walk most places. You don't want to drive because traffic here is terrible.  We spent way too much time in the car trying to get to places.  So if we came back we would do more walking and pick places to go that were within walking distance.

Minuses: Room is dimly lit.  If you want a bright light there is none to be found (including in the bathroom).   Covers are thin and not very plush. We got out a 2nd (thin) blanket out of the closet.  No real blanket like one thinks of a blanket but they do have easy to change thermostat controls on the wall so you can control the temp in the room easily.  Kingsize bed seems shorter in length so if you're really tall you might inquire about this.  They only have shower stalls (didn't affect us but if you have small children then this might be a problem).  

When you pull up to check in the valet takes your car to park it at a cost of $29/night. ($32 with tax)  It sometimes takes awhile for them to fetch your car and then you feel obligated to tip.  If we came back we would insist on parking our car ourselves. (there are lots nearby where you can park cheaper) But of course when you first arrive you don't know this.

The breakfast area is on the 3rd floor.  We were on the 4th floor. All floors look down at the breakfast area which is noisy so I would recommend asking for a floor higher up to keep noise level down.

The thing we disliked most was the breakfast.  For a place of this calibur, you would think they would have a rocking breakfast. pancakes were hard as bricks, not a good fruit selection (no bananas or oranges only grapefruit and apples). choc cake donuts and cinnamon covered mini donuts which were hard and dry.  The only hot food choice was egg mcmuffin sandwiches which tasted kind of dry. no hot water to make tea even though they had tea bags. we had to ask for OJ.  No bacon or sausage to be seen which should be a breakfast bar staple.  They ran out of cups for OJ  and seemed to take a long time to restock and the place was not that busy at 8:30 in the morning.  Just think a hotel of this calibur should have a better breakfast selection.",0,_XlS79khM5gS6-2j_4ftlw

Philly mints many exciting pop-ups into full brick-and-mortar establishments. Among them is El Merkury, a fast-casual spot promising an accessible assortment of Central American street food staples. The walls and stamped tin ceilings are whitewashed, decorated with colorful cubbies on one side and a spraypaint-stenciled, kitchen-themed mural on the other. Bright yellow and deep blue aluminum tables and chairs complement the vibrant Spanish music playing in the background. Garage door-style windows open widely, greeting the summer weather with panache.

My partner and I stopped by the Rittenhouse outpost for dinner, and we opted for two combo platters and churro. As we waited at our table, I was surprised and impressed that the staff offered near-restaurant quality service. They brought out iced water, then staggered the entrees and dessert. The entrees could be summed up as well-portioned and sturdy, with an exciting assortment of textures and spot-on sauces, but underwhelmingly flavored meats. The Cheese-Baked Rice absolutely hit the spot. The richness of melty cheese was balanced out by sweet corn. The guacamole ran on the pureed side, emulating a sauce more than a dip. Seasoned with lime and pickled onions, it was refreshing and flavorful. The beans were well-cooked with a good texture. The plantain chips held up to the scoop test and proved to be an ideal side to pair with the beans and guac. I appreciated that they were longitudinally cut, but I wish they were salted -- the chips sans dip definitely were underwhelming. Our meal ended with a bang thanks to the Galletas Abue Churro. Looping spectacularly from a cup of soft-serve, the sight of the churros is second only to the taste. Our variety was heavy in indulgent flavors of cinnamon and sugar, and the soft-serve was drizzled with dulce de leche and wafer cookies. The made-to-order churro was piping hot, slightly melting the adjacent soft-serve and intensifying the lusciousness. In fact, I'd say the churro is reason enough to pay El Merkury a visit. Even though you'll definitely want a churro for yourself, you may find that your eyes are bigger than your stomach. Surprisingly heavy, the portion is fair to split between two.

For $40 for two (after tax and tip), El Merkury definitely runs the Rittenhouse-standard price for a fast-casual affair. While the food might not have blown my socks off, it was a solid foray into the star of the meal. The churro selection has my strong endorsement as ranking among the best dessert option in Philly.",4,6C8Ne6yRu6TzBLbhfhdduw

----


Attention Mister Manager you are getting destroyed on social media and I'll be sending this to corporate as well.  *** You need to have a talk with cashiers Mary and Mollie.***  Read on.

I was into your University Place location today at 250 3rd St S Saint Petersburg  It's Sunday February 25, 2018 and this was about noontime.  I literally come in your store every day and spent at least 10 grand there over the past year.

So today the dairy isle as usual was full of holes.  Every time I go in there it's the same damn story:  poor management by the dairy manager and a lack luster crew of slow motion morons.  They never order enough of their more popular items so it looks like some sort of third world flea market.  Today yiu were out of three staple items.  Let's use one as an example:  Jumbo eggs.  There was one dozen left on the shelf and it had one broken egg in it.  What it someone supposed to buy that?  And not a dairy worker to be found.

The stockers themselves move at a virtual snails pace.  To make matters worse they don't know their job.  To do it right you FILL HOLES FIRST.  All they are doing is acting like dumb little drones and dragging the stuff out there in whatever comes into their moronic little hands.  A good manager needs to light a fire under their ass!  What's the first thing to do when you come in to work in the morning?  For each hole you have hustle your ass out back and grab a case!  This isn't rocket science people.  It's grocery store 101!

So at checkout on the end register Mary checks me out and says ""did you find everything OK?""  I said ""actually no you were out of three staple items I needed and dairy looks like a bomb hit it.""  So Mollie who is bagging says ""that's because the shipment hasn't come in yet.""  Aside for the fact that this is STILL the stores fault, that is an *excuse* and not a *reason*.  But that's really not what pissed me off.

At this point I explained my experience in grocery stores and said ""you asked me if I found everything so I told you.""  And I said ""I'll bet if I go back there I can find those items.""  To which Mary said in a really smart ass sing song tone:  ""No you won't because like we told you the shipment hasn't come in yet.""  I was was furious but bit my lip. No apologies:  NOTHING.

Upon exiting I asked to speak to the Customer Service Rep.  She seemed like she was doing me some big ass favor to take 2 minutes to talk to me.  But it gets worse.  She told me ""the shipment has been in for half an hour!""  So I went back and told Mary and Mollie who seemed ""mollified"" I would dare come back to confront them how not only were they rude, but they were misinformed (or lying) and I was right all along.  Had I gone out back I *would* have found my staple items.  Do you think they apologized?  No.  They seemed bothered and put out that I would confront them on their ignorance.

Quite frankly I would fire Mary.  What a sh!tty way to treat your customers.  Ask your custoif they found everything OK and when they haven't tell the customer to go pound sand?  One loses track of how many kinds of wrong this is.  I think I'll start heading over to Winn Dixie for a change.",0,iPiJEEpHgRokb1A4I9IwbA

(Picture uploaded) obviously I'm upset about this with intentions on calling them to complain, but to make matters worse as I'm forking through the rice, there is a strand of hair in it!

The sales people (Mark & Alison aka AlliMark), were sympathetic to our problem and promised to oversee the installation personally, but that never happened, and he never responded to any of my emails or phone calls, and when i saw him at a local home show and showed him pictures, his only response was ""yeah, they should fix that ... call them.""

Situated in a shotgun-style space, the pub is seldom empty and always cramped in a space reasonably like its ancestors that survived WW II. Not having been to Ireland I can only say McCreary's serves as close to any ""pub lunch"" I've experienced in the UK.

The pub owns bragging rights as a Franklin Main Street staple whose well-worn charm lands it somewhere between upscale dive and legit Irish pub. It's open 8-days a week and for most street festivals. The environment can be boisterous and close with SRO sometimes at the small bar (and be sure to look for the seat used by Gen. Schofield as he rested with a black and tan on his stroll to Nashville circa Thanksgiving of 1864.)

YMMV, though it's simpler than leggin' it to Dublintown. I go for the fish and chips. Served on an almost leaky faux newsprint wrap, the fish is excellent with a good crisp to the coating. My tater preference is thin and crisp, so I'm not a fan of the chips (known elsewhere as thick-cut steak fries.) Other notable dishes are the chicken pie, shepherd's pie, and the corned beef.

I only ever went there once, and I made the mistake of ordering a sandwich that didn't have any meat on it. I think the name or its description must have somehow implied that it was Italian, and Italian sandwiches - like the BMT at Subway, or the Vito at Jimmy John's, or the Gaba Gool from the Pork Store on The Sopranos - are of course known for having the most meat of any kind of sandwich. That's part of the reason why I eat them. (The other reason is that they're delicious.) The sandwich I had was one of the better sandwiches I've ever eaten, but still.

This may have played a role in Dave & Tony's gourmet sandwich predecessor ultimately going out of business.

It'd be a lot more difficult to accidentally order a sandwich without meat on it from Dave & Tony's. I'm not even sure if they offer any burgers without meat. I think I did once read somewhere that they sell a turkey sandwich, for women with gigantic asses trying to front like they're going on a diet. But there's no way I'd ever accidentally order it, thinking it was a turkey burger, because of course I would never eat a turkey burger. Take a look around. This is America.

The way Dave & Tony's works is you get in line and pick up a sort of checklist order form and one of those tiny pencils you use to bet on horses. You go down the list and check off all the things you want on your burger and how you'd like it prepared. Some of the things cost a little bit extra, but that's not a big deal, because you expect to pay upwards of $10 for a burger and fries at a place like this. You pay that much for a burger and fries at Five Guys, and Five Guys sucks balls. Yeah, I imagine this could get to be a bit much, if you've got a family to put food on, but maybe that's something you should have thought about before you had a family. It's too late to turn back now and not have it be frowned upon by society.

I've ordered from both the checklist menu and the list of Signature burgers they offer. The first time I went there, I got some combination of blue cheese, red onions, lettuce and maybe a few other things (but not too many) on a pretzel bun, and the shit was amazing. The pretzel bun in particular is to slap your mother for. I would have gotten the same thing the other day, or something similar (because I can't even remember exactly what it was), but I couldn't see for shit. I'd just come from a retina specialist, where I'd had both my pupils dilated, and I'm already blind out of one eye. (Yeah, I drove like that. #priorities) It was the most I could do to order something from the relatively large list of Signature burgers. I never could quite read the sides menu, so I just ordered french fries and hoped they only come in one size. I think they do. The guy taking my order probably thought I can't read.

I went with the Steakhouse Burger, which is not unlike those godawful steakhouse burgers they used to have at Burger King, but without any mashed potatoes. Toppings included crispy onion strips, lettuce and blue cheese. It wasn't altogether different from what I had before, but it didn't come on that delicious pretzel bun, which must cost $.06 more to make. Next time I might see if I can't substitute it. The meat was amazing both times I was there. I was surprised, because it didn't take very long to make, which leads me to believe it's somehow precooked. But you could hardly tell from eating it. The inside was nice and juicy, and not overdone. I ordered mine medium. I love nothing more than the taste of almost raw beef, but I didn't want to take any chances. Maybe next time I will.

The fries are almost equally as great. Almost, because they're not made out of meat, natch. They come served in some fou fou tall white cardboard container, which is probably what MIA eats her fries out of, but as far as I know there's no truffle oil or anything involved - just grease and salt. You can tell they're made more or less fresh, but don't worry. They're not those gross natural cut fries that almost taste like they're good for you. These taste like they're horrible for you.",6,xx-6o9MW5B92VaWmRJwEMA

I ended up ordering a hot Katsu sandwich and a side of waffle fries. Although I wish it was a milk bread bun, the pretzel but went fine with the katsu that was super crispy and spicy. Two checks in my book. There were two cutlets on the sandwich and wow I had to eat around it cause it didn't fit in my mouth.

In fact, we engaged one - for a pretty big job - and lost two months waiting until we gave up. Then we got the recommendation of Angel Tree Service from our neighbor. They answered the phone immediately, and with a reasonable small visit fee, came out quickly to offer advice and prepare an estimate. Already this was far more professional than any tree service we have used in our 20 years here in central Jersey. 

The owner, Sebastian, came himself. He spent ample time with us to hear our concerns, our ling term desires, and assess our situation.  Another good sign. 

On the day work was to begin the team came out exactly when they promised to - something else that was refreshing for us.  Led by the owner. Each man in bright shirt, hardhat, eye protection, etc. Real pros and clearly put safety first. Plus you could see the great attitude - it was natural to surmise that these guys are treated well and like their jobs and their boss.  This was an accurate assessment and it showed in the work. 

In addition the team came with several gleaming machines and took great care getting to our yard. 

The work did not stop until the job was done. Watching the crew was very satisfying as everyone was contributing in one way or another - they did not waste a moment. Their specialists who work in the cherry-picker are especially impressive - Taking a large tree down starting at the top, adjacent to our neighbors property, without a branch falling where they didn't want it to. 

In addition to multiple trees to be cut and trimmed, we had them remove stumps. This occurred on the second day. The stump grinder operator could not have taken more care. He went through our large property to find every stump - large and small. This was beyond our imagination and delighted us. 

All of this, under the supervision of the dynamic and responsible, young man owner, Sebastian.

Here is my recent bait and switch experience this week (1/18/21) when signing up for a member ship.
If you had a similar experience report it to Contact@fitnessintl.com as i did 
Hopefully it will prevent others from being scammed and or lied too. 

Below is a complaint letter I sent, explaining and naming those involved.  

Greetings customer service,

I am writing to bring to your attention a membership scam that is going on in one for your clubs. (St Petersburg, FL @4th St North)
This scam is being conducted at the GM and Assistant GM level.  

On tuesday Jan 18th, 2021 I was baited in with a below corporate pricing rate by your Assistant Manager Rose.  I was promised a rate of $300 for a National Signature Club membership.  I purchased 2, 1 for myself and 1 for my wife. ($600 total).  

Your GM Taylor sat with Rose and I to write this membership. He helped her with navigating through your system as she gave the impression as being a new hire. 
As we got to the totals I pointed out a ""balance owed"" that showed up on the screen.  They both assured me they would be overwriting it that same evening (1/18/21).  In addition, Rose said ""YOU HAVE MY WORD"" and explained she would follow up with me by 10am the next day (1/19/21) to illustrate the balance would go away.  

1-2 hours later that same night (1/18/21), I got a strange call from Sabrina, the Operations Manager questioning my balance.  I explained the above, I was told Taylor was going to overwrite it""  She began to rant about how Rose was going to pay my balance and how that having her pay the balance is not right so my memberships will have to be canceled.  
NOTE - Having anyone pay any balance was never discussed to me.  I was told Taylor would overwrite it. Thats is.  

There are more details (more misleading/lies when initiating my complaint) but I wanted to keep this fist email to share the main underlying issues.  

This is your GM and Assistant Manager
Who knows how many other cases where they have been successful in stealing money from LA fitness and or ripping off its customers in fraudulent agreements. 

Words cannot describe the disgust in lack of business & human ethics your senior managing employees are generating.  

I was told by ""Mathew I"" at your customer service headquarters that District Vice President Todd knew of this incident.  

On 1/20/21 I finally got a call from Todd  and he flat out lied to me as he stated "" I was on the phone with Rose when she was signing you up and you knew you'd have a balance due""   
It appears Todd the District VP condones and or participates in this misconduct.  What a disgusting culture.

I'm writing to you and will continue to go up the chain of command in hopes to find someone of integrity that can take ownership and reprimand such malpractice.  

For the record I have the text thread exposing the Assistant GM Rose baiting me in a ""paid in full"" rate they would later not honor and lie about.  
see attached.  So far no one from LA Fitness wants to own up to this..till they do you can enjoy the truth and be informed about how management of LA Fitness on 4th street in St Pete, FL operate. 

I hope to hear from high level Regional VP or higher that wants to make right.",1,sZdCbrTCOyPCGTPd5JoWTQ

I even sent a facebook message to them, and they looked at it and ignored it. The hours on their website says they close at 9, and I called to place an order around 7:40. No answer. I work nights, and often eat around this time when I am at work, so that's why I want to call in an order but no one wants to answer the phone. Very bad and unprofessional customer service.

I was greeted right away and shown to our seats. Our waitress had a really flat affect that kind of made me feel uncomfortable since she clearly didn't want to be there. I asked for a Jack and ginger and she said she didn't know if they had ginger ale that occasionally they had random cans of it. They were able to find some for my drink. We both ordered steaks which came with a starter salad, steak, sauce, a generous side, and garlic cheese bread. I had the Caesar served with anchovies, a small filet with the cognac sauce, and a baked potato. My steak was cooked well and the baked potato was a good size the food was pretty good. The prices however are pretty outrageous for what you get. I'm happy we went on a groupon I definitely wouldn't have paid over $100 for our two steaks normally. I hope they do well because of their rich history in St. Louis I just can't see myself paying those prices in Westport for no view and no more exceptional service as I had come to love at Kemoll's.",0,-dgC1iRp_JqBTmn5d1wRhg

I will start with positive feedback. The food was excellent and we had a good relationship with our first event planner. Our venue the Stotesbury Mansion was gorgeously fabulous.

From there it goes downhill. I worked with 3+ wedding planner over the course of 9mo planning process. We loved Lauren. Bernice was a little unresponsive but knowledgeable . However, Bernice was very unprofessional in not telling us that she never planned to actually be present at our event (she noted that this is not uncommon for Feastivities.) However, we only learned of her absence at our rehearsal. I do not remember the name of my new planner because I only talked to her for about 5 minutes and at that time she was busy planning for someone elses event which occurred in the same venue immediately after the rehearsal. She was clearly overwhelmed. On the day of our wedding, she had NO clue of our schedule or vendors. She was obviously disinterested and confused and she blamed all delays and confusion on myself, my family and my day of coordinator. I feel that our wedding which had a pretty healthy budget was not priority for them and their staff.

Wharton students are not the Inn-keepers of these supposed 'luxury' establishments, rather poor uneducated simple people who live in one of the poorest cities in the United States. No one from the Cornell school of hospitality and hotel management is employed at these wretched places that much I can assure you. 

At my most recent outing at the Logan I awoke at 5 am to the sound of electric staplers and screw drivers working about in the room directly above me. I called down the front desk to ask them if they could kindly do something about the noise. They told me that unfortunately the room needed repairs and work has been done on it all week. Very well, then why on earth would you check me into  the room below it if you knew men with electric tools would be pounding away at 5 am. 

Calling to book the hotel, I asked about the spa, and they said it was 'state of the art and brand new' only to find out once I've checked in that it hadn't even been opened yet. Frightening.

The Four Seasons used to inhabit the Logan Hotel's space. I can see why they left, they didn't want to tarnish their reputation with a property that could not find experienced hospitality people to employ in Philly. The poor and uneducated Philadelphia work force is ill equipped to handle the necessities of guest willing to pay 500 plus a night for a hotel room. Sadly, the jokes on the customer, for one reason or another we must be in Philadelphia, probably for something to do more with the 'mainline brass' than the rest of its population and we must allow ourselves to be swindled less we find ourselves in a best western advertising its premium cable package on a sign in its conveniently located parking lot with double wide trailer capacity!

I explained that I was focused on the seizures, and unless he was due for shots or anything else, I wasn't interested at this point. She told me I needed to bring my dog in every 2 weeks to do blood work to check the levels of the prescription. The prescription right away had several awful side effects. (I found out via internet- not the vet- that it was normal). All the while he was having seizures still and I'm spending hundreds on the frequent blood work and prescriptions. Once during the blood work they made him bleed for about a hour due to their sloppy work. Finally, exasperated after months of this, I called the vet and told her the medicine had negative side effects and he was still seizing, she said ""yeah it's not working let's just stop treatment.' And that was that. Time and money wasted. My dog was worse then when I brought him in. (I found out online the type of medicine he was on, HAD to be weened off or it could be very hazardous) So thank you google for saving my dog. I found another vet quickly who assessed my dog asked questions and finally recommended that I try switching his food first. Needless to say my pup has been seizure free for a year and half. And it cost me just the price of a physical exam. No blood work, no prescriptions.

I liked it so much that I gave my daughter a gift certificate for her birthday.  She had a facial done and really enjoyed it.  She gave a CASH tip of $20.  She even booked another appointment because she loved the service.
The following day she received a phone call from the front desk wondering why she not left a tip!  She informed them that she had INDEED given $20 to the therapist.  Who would have the nerve to call about not giving a tip?  A tip is not mandatory!!!  No one has to give one unless the individual wants to.
A few days later I called Essentials and asked to speak to the manager.  I was told she was not available.  I left my phone number and told the front desk why I was calling.  The front desk clerk assured me that my call would be returned.  I waited for one week and had not received a call.  I then decided to stop by the Spa.  Again I was told that the manager was not there.  It just so happened that the person I spoke to was the one who called my daughter.  She made a note to give to the manager.  She asked me what I expected them to do.  I told her that I would expect the manager to offer my daughter a complimentary facial.  Once again, the manager never called me. I find this appalling!!!

My 16 year old book loving daughter spotted the sign for Books & Brews while we were passing by. I remembered I had bookmarked this place as a ""to visit"", so we decided to check it out and get a mid-afternoon snack. 

It's a little hard to find, but SO worth it.  It is actually in a non-descript building/strip to the side of the Home Depot off 96th.   

The front of this place is filled with an eclectic blend of (donated?) books, cool TShirts, a big table, and a TV with an old skool Nintendo and games.  We sat here for our snack as you have to be 21 to enter the tap room in the back. They DO have a kids menu!  Today there was a cool dude singing and playing guitar for the small crowd gathered at the bar -- and we could hear him up front.  Cool.  

The menu at first glance seems limited -- mostly variations on grilled cheese sandwiches. Don't let this dissuade you.  These were THE BEST sandwiches and chips we have had in a really really long time.  I opted for the Beowulf (turkey and havarti dill) and Bird had the Hamlet (local ham and smoked gouda) -- and we think the bread was home made. Chips via Broadripple Chip Company really set the sandies off.  Must be laced with crack because I have wanted more of these chips and another sandie ever since. No joke. 

I went to the tap room to order and immediately felt comfortable with the folks there.  I was offered tastes of the literary themed brews (all were good!) and settled on the 8 ounce pour of a Maple Pumpkin seasonal for like $3.  It is fall and was 2:30 in the afternoon after all. :)   They also offer pints and growlers -- and I will totally return for a growler fill asap sans daughter and plus husband. 

When we went to settle the bill one of our sandwiches was half off.  Score!  Not sure if it was a Tuesday afternoon special or what, but it was cool with me.  2 amazing sandies and a beer for less than $20. Yes. 

Why I will return: 
1) events every day listed on chalkboard including board game nights, open mic, etc. 
2) wide variety of beers brewed in house 
3) friendly staff and patrons -- very engaging
4) good food!
5) books. 


Ps: check out the soup. :)",2,fbO2EDVPgRk5UQ8NE7QVHw

My husband and I travel extensively and consider ourselves tolerant and polite people.  This hotel is for families with kids -- and by that I simply mean that it is NOISY.  If you are in your late 50s and want to go to bed at a reasonable hour, do NOT stay here.  Unbeknownst to us, we had no idea that we would have such a nightmarish 1-night stay.  The room next to ours sounded like it was hosting a child's birthday party, beginning at midnight, and it continued on for hours.  We finally had to complain to the staff and they sent hotel security up to have a ''talk'' with them.  The noise and nonsense stopped for about 15 minutes and then it resumed.  Needless to say, we did not sleep most of the night so we were anything but refreshed from what should have been a decent night's sleep for $140.00.

It's def. chill vibes - laid back with about 15 beers on tap that includes sours, ales, lagers, porters (I am always rooting for more porters/stouts), etc. The gigantic monster mural with a projector of fish swimming in the background is really cool. They invite vendors to participate in a market get together with free swag bags, so I encourage you to do a lil shoppin' and lots of sippin'! Also, 81Bay is big on supporting our  Veterans, which I appreciate because a large percentage of my family is/was in the military.

It's a perfect spot to grab a delicious lunch with pals - either sit inside [if you can find a stool at their counter-style set up] or take it outside on their patio or enjoy it from the steps of the Solider and Sailor Monument which is just steps away from their door.

My go-to: The Georgia O'Keefe garden salad, buffalo chicken panini, and a LaCroix! 

They serve SO MANY styles of soups, salads, and paninis that if you can't find one you like - be it broth or cream based, vegan, vegetarian, or meat lovers - that's on you. They let you sample soups until you find one you like and their service is next to none - SOUPER [see what I did there?] helpful employees that will suggest a favorite meal!

It's only been open for about a month and is in a surprising location: the Downtown Indianapolis Marriott. The restaurant is part of the hotel's renovation project and strives to re-imagine what ""hotel food"" can taste like, which is a good thing because most of the hotel food in my life has been BAD! The restaurant serves three meals a day, all elevated takes on classic Midwestern comfort food.

Let's talk about getting there first. Parking is a struggle for the uninitiated because the whole block is surrounded by parking garages. Go into the wrong one and you're stuck with a $35 parking fee that is not validated by the restaurant. We definitely learned this the hard way, so we're sticking to valet parking next time, which our host told us is complementary when dining at the restaurant. I'm a little nervous to take them up on it after our last parking debacle, but I do like valet parking...

Connor's looks nice from the outside with patio seating and a modern fireplace. It looks nice from the inside too with leather seats, stylish art displays, and succulents at every table. I was a little disappointed with my greeting because I was never welcomed to the restaurant or asked if I had dined there before. Our server brought us water and then asked to take our order without ever introducing herself or telling us about any specials. Lame! I did ask her to please tell me more about the menu to help inform my decision-making process.

My sister and I ended up splitting Lump Crab Hushpuppies ($11) and Truffle Chips ($8) for our appetizers, but it was a hard choice because options like cheesy monkey bread and cornbread muffins were also on the menu. For my entrée, I went with Baked Mac and Cheese with cavatappi noodles, thick-cut bacon, english peas, and a parmesan crust ($16). Sister ordered a 1/2 rack of Hickory Smoked Baby Back Ribs ($16). I was almost too full for dessert, but when I saw Peanut Butter Pretzel Pie ($8) was an option, I had to give it a try. See what I mean? Comfort food! So many good choices on the menu!

Overall thoughts? The food was good, but not great. Everything went down smoothly, but nothing was particularly memorable or worth driving downtown for. I'm not going to argue if a friend wants to meet up there because there are many other dishes on the menu to try, but I'm also not going to rush back. I like that they take reservations and (maybe) have free valet parking. I also appreciated the modern vibe of the space, but the music was also a little loud and it was definitely not a place for an intimate conversation. In addition, I think service could improved to show more warmth and hospitality. Downtown Indy just has so many food options, so I think Connor's needs to continue being innovative and outgoing in order to rise about the fierce competition.",5,bNnBwW5kNO77KTgMeVhxKg

Things to keep in mind:

1. First... this is NOT high class dining in a fancy resort.

This is fast food that mostly specializes in breakfast in a very small town, with limited selection of staff.

2. These are not money-hungry savages that are looking to impress their bosses up the corporate ladder or pitch their innovative ideas in Shark Tank.

3. They are not making great money slinging biscuits out the Windows.

4. Between Pleasant View and Joelton there exists a decent void of good customer service and decent fast food.
If you doubt that try the infamous McDonald's in Joelton or the KFC/TB in Pleasant View.

This place is always slammed in the morning with cars ringing the driveway.

Why is that?

Answer: Because they have a decent breakfast.

Also because they have an issue with efficiency.
Now I am not talking about just making you wait another 5 mins because you ordered a deep fried chicken biscuit.

I made the mistake of going there on a Sunday morning and seeing the line of cars, went inside.

Inside there was a line of people both waiting on their food and waiting to order.

Now with that kind of rush you would think they place would be operating like a machine... you know.. everyone doing their part.

Nope.

Oblivious to the huge backup, I watched an employee decide it was a great time to show a coworker a video on their phone, then decide it was time to go and use the restroom. 
Same employee was not wearing gloves handling food right before that.
I did not wait for his return from the restroom to witness further hygiene violation, instead walked out the door.

I went across the street to Burger King where they actually have a decent chicken biscuit.

Now have I occasionally braved the morning rush in order to satisfy my low blood sugar driven desires.....well yes.

Is the food normally hot and fresh... well yes... yes it is...",0,q7wyyOsAB7OigTSENOe8JA

Overall the experience was good and would give them another try. The pros are that the price is super on point and the staff is incredibly kind. The horses seemed very well taken care of and were well mannered (and are rescues!). The guides did a great job of teaching on the ride and allowing more experienced riders a bit more freedom which not a lot of places do! The cons are that the trails were really not great. It could have been from the weather we were having, but I am unsure. Maneuvering through the trees something we had to constantly do (if you weren't on your A game you would either be clipped by a tree or get your leg caught in one). The trails were not clearly marked, and it felt like we were navigating through the woods trying to find a trail. Haha. Which honestly I would have minded as much if I had the right equipment. Which is the second con. I know they have a lot of people to manage, but my saddle, girth, and stirrups were all a poor choice for me and the horse I was riding. The stirrups were two different ones and couldn't get the length right, the saddle was too small for me and the girth was too big for the horse. I felt like I was slipping and going to fall off multiple times. The guides did their best to adjust me,  but the only way for it really to have been fixed was to switch the equipment, but I didn't want to hold up the group. Which brings me to the last con- the group was too large. There were about 13-15 people in our group which was just too much for a ride. That caused some other problems which were completely not the fault of the guides, but the large group I believe aided in some of the issues we had. 

Overall it was a good time, and I would try them again. I just hope they clean up their trails and I would be more vocal about equipment.",3,2Kwvt7ms6qHxbwvW0g_fFQ

My visits never felt rushed and the attention I received felt very personalized.

My go-to bagel breakfast sandwich is an everything bagel with bacon, veggie cream cheese, tomato and cucumber. This is obviously not a combo that's offered online (or anywhere, probably, because it's super random!) so over the weekend I instead ordered a BLT, hold the L, plus some extra bagels and cream cheese to have on hand. I was able to add my desired cream cheese to my BT bagel, and now I have bagels in my freezer for whenever I want one.   

I've never had an issue with my order, and I love having a bagel shop in the neighborhood that's both walkable and available for delivery on a lazy Sunday morning.",16,ET8n-r7glWYqZhuR6GcdNw

So I love the interior decoration. Lots of repurposed items!! Tables from reclaimed wood. My fav !! The colors are inviting and it's a nice open space. They even have garage doors in the front that can be opened in nicer weather. 

Now the one and only server was AWESOME-SAUCE!  He was pleasant, friendly and very knowledgeable. Not to mention had the most patience I've seen from someone working an entire lunch crowd by themselves. So dude, not sure of your name, kudos to you 

I ordered the Funghi (may have misspelled) pizza. It is the one with Olive oil, mushrooms, mozzarella, and truffle oil. You can not go wrong with truffle oil!

Needless to say there are no pics b/c I devoured it in epic time.

The crust is thin and crispy, not soggy like some thin crust pizzas. We also had the calamari. It comes flash fried over a small amount of marinara. It had a great taste...not a big fan if marinara and could have done without.

My lunch buddy had the pizza with the artichokes...yummy as well.

The staff was very friendly and helpful but I honestly did not have a good experience at this pet resort. On their website it states that it's $33 per dog if they are staying in a queen room. So I booked my two labradors separate rooms with a doggy door that joined the rooms so that they could still be together and have their own space. I booked this 3 months in advance. They didn't book it correctly in their system so that there would be 2 queen rooms next to each other, so they moved one of my dogs to a king room without contacting me prior. Then they also charged me for moving my dog without my permission because of THEIR mistake. This was an extra $7 per day and they stayed for 11 days so that's $77. 

When I was dropping them off they also told me that it was $10 for my dogs to play for half a day. They did not specify that it was $10 for each dog individually. I paid for these play sessions every other day. So that was an extra $60 that I was charged because the receptionist neglected to inform us about the pricing accurately. 

I was about to leave the pet resort but I realized that I forgot to inform them that I didn't give them my information to get my military discount which was 10% off the tab ($80). When I went inside, she informed me that I actually owed HER money because of the facilities mistakes. That included the $7 dollars per night because they moved my dog to a larger room without my permission and the extra $10 every other day for my dogs play time. So that was $137 that they were saying I 'owed' them. So instead of eating the $137 because they were obviously in the wrong, they 'let it go' by making the charges even with the military discount I was supposed to get.... I believe that they should have dealt with this in a different manner than they did. 

On top of that I asked them to clean my chocolate labradors ears after he swam and I believe they didn't even do that. When he came home he had lots of dirty ear wax in his ears and they were red from irritation. Both dogs were very upset when I picked them up and wouldn't really look at me or my boyfriend. They also were sick and had diarrhea for 2 days and I'm not sure why. 

Overall I did not have a good experience with this facility and I would much rather go to a place like Pet Paradise. They charge 70 something dollars each day for both of my dogs but play time is included (which new Tampa pet resort didn't specify on their website that it wasn't included either) and they actually take care of their animals.",2,8NRkt995fzc5j23xpBnZlQ

I was excited to buy this vehicle. Kendall Ford touts their "" 130-point mechanical inspection of every vehicle by factory-trained technicians"" which I found reassuring as I would be driving my young children back home to Washington in this vehicle. 

I guess their 130-point mechanical inspection of every vehicle by factory-trained technicians does not include checking the windshield wiper fluid lines, as mine were cut. Or the heater, which does not work. Or the head lights which turn off when I turn on the windshield wipers, or the heated seats which only work half of the time, or the door that fills with water every time it rains.

I suppose I should have checked some of those items. I simply didn't think about it as it was a hot, sunny summer day when I purchased my vehicle and my mind was far from thinking about rain, or cold weather. Plus, you know, the much-touted 130 point mechanical inspection.

Once Kendall Ford made their sale, that was it. Repeated calls  to the dealership have been made with no response. Messages are left with receptionists over and over again to no avail.

A second opinion was had from a competitor who brought their scope & discovered steel wool stuffed into the pipe. Not using steel wool previously, we don't know how it got there. The line was rootered out for a similar fee that should have been done right the first time. I don't think I would recommend or use them again.",0,7phXv78LodZ6gNAHOgGabQ

Truthfully, I've probably walked past this place dozens of times in Rittenhouse without noticing it.  We had to park a few blocks away because it is Rittenhouse afterall.  

When we entered there were two young women at the hostess stand who looked bored and not exactly welcoming,  but we let them know that we were waiting for my cousin, and we were led inside to a decent bar area.

The style is straight out of Colonial Mexico with nice accents like woodcarvings on the entryways.  We were seated in the back of the restaurant.  Our seats were half-booth and half-chairs.  It was kind of a pain for those of us who were seated eight-across on the booth side.  

We ordered specialty guacamole for some of our appetizers.  The bacon guacamole and a crabmeat guacamole were delicious.    I thought my dinner entrée, Shrimp Wrapped Bacon Stuffed with Cheese, was too much on the salty side.  I was glad that I had ordered a sweet drink called the Coco Loco (coconut infused siembra azul tequila blanco, canton ginger liquor, pineapple juice, sugar cane syrup and fresh lime juice) to balance out my salty dinner.  I also got to try the Short Rib (siembra azul blanco infused with jalapeño, fresh lime juice, and pomegranate molasses).  This drink is really good if you like a spicy cocktail!

The servers were very friendly and attentive even with our large party.  I think the best things about this place were the decor and the servers.  When I come back it will be for the guacamole and the Short Rib cocktail.",2,M6lYbYEL66cyL7ssHBGD7A

They're perhaps most famous for their hummus, but to stop at the hummus would be missing out in so much of what makes Zahav amazing. 

Highly recommend the salatim, which comes with 6 different vegetable sides. The sides were delicious, and on the night we went, we had wax beans, stewed tomato, cauliflower stems, beets, Moroccan carrots with pine nuts, and eggplant. The beets were phenomenal, shredded and mixed in with tahini. Also quite liked the eggplant, which was nice and savory/salty, and then stewed tomato, which had a nice sweetness to it. I loved how each of the sides had its own distinct flavor and they worked together to make a delicious start to the meal. 

Other than that, tried a number of other dishes including:

Haloumi - Interesting mix of flavors as it was actually sweet from the jam/sauce. 

Fried cauliflower - Delicious and not too oily despite being fried. The labneh was a nice touch. 

Crudo - This was to me the most standard / least exciting dish but others disagreed with me saying it was their favorite. Just goes to show that every dish here is delicious. 

Chicken - Wasn't expecting this to be this delicious and juicy. Sooo good. 

Hanger steak - Also delicious and tender (I personally liked the chicken more but my dining companion said the steak was their favorite)

Eggplant - My favorite of the Al Ha'esh items, along with the chicken. So much flavor packed into this tender eggplant. The eggplant is topped with lentils and a white sauce.

Lamb mergeuz - Good but I'm not generally the biggest fan of this dish, and it was the least exciting Al Ha'esh item for me as well. 

The hummus of course is excellent. I personally like the regular hummus over the Turkish hummus, which is served hot, because I found the Turkish version a bit too buttery, but it's really a matter of personal preference as others in my party preferred the Turkish hummus.

I went last night to see Courtney Robbins play.  Courtney was, as always, fantastic.  The rest of the experience was decidedly not so.  

First off, I generally dislike the renovations.  There is much less seating in the back room and it feels awkward to get around the whole venue now.  The only part of the renovations that I did like was the bar, which now serves both the lounge and the back.  However, there was only one bartender for all of it, so the service was even slower than usual.  And even when I've had my most positive experiences at Plush, the service has always been slow.

Last night the bar service was flat out awful.  If I was rating based on that alone, I'd wish I could give 0 stars.  Kenny, the bartender who was working, used to be my favorite there.  He's interesting and tells good stories.  He's never been good at handling volume, but he was always nice.  Last night, it was him and one barback.  He didn't even come to our side of the bar, leaving the barback to tend to people there.  We waited for ages before finally being acknowledged.  The barback called Kenny to make our drinks because he didn't know how.  Kenny refused.  The barback tried to make one drink, started putting the wrong alcohol in the shaker, and got mad when my friend gently corrected him.  He was probably mad at Kenny for making him make drinks he shouldn't have been making, but he was a total jackass to us.  And Kenny should have been doing his damn job.  We did not purchase drinks and our mood was soured.  I had missed Plush a little bit before, having had many good experiences there in the past, but each of the last several times I've been the experience has been a little less pleasant, culminating in last night's poor treatment.

That being said, I was VERY excited to check out Grandma's cookies. As a cookie connoisseur (yeah, I went there), I have to say that the cookies were solid, but not amazing. They reminded me a little of Italian cookies or shortbread, in that they were just a tad bit dry. 

Don't expect a gourmet bakery - this place is very unpretentious and simple, as a good cookie itself is. There were lots to choose from: chocolate chip, sugar cookie, snicker doodle, coconut, oatmeal raisin, etc. Oddly enough, there were no chocolate cookies however, like the infamously delicious chocolate crinkle....but I digress. There were also cupcakes, which seemed misplaced to me...kind of like an ""add-on"" to get any extra income from the cupcake ""craze."" 

With all the lovely dessert choices in St. Charles, I'm not sure I would go back to Grandma's Cookies. But, what this place does have going for it is very reasonable prices and a nice variety of cookies for most palettes.",5,qK7SNRzmHDHrAcNHSIujyg

I would've given it two stars if not for the elegant ambience, and of course, those 25 cents martinis, which were delicious!  However, the food was sub-par, and nearly all of them were over-salted.  

We tried:

Creole Gumbo - Woah, someone dumped a whole bucketful of salt in this dish.  This was our last meal in NOLA and I really wanted to have one last good bowl of gumbo as it has become my favorite dish during this trip.  I was so disappointed when I tried this dish, there was only one flavor note, salt.  Moreover, the roux was too thick, giving the dish a gelatinous feel. 

Cauliflower Soup - must've been the same person that made the gumbo, as this one was also crazy salty.  I passed the soup around my table of six and each person took one spoonful and commented on the salt level.

Flat bread - this was a beautiful dish, almost too beautiful to eat. There was an abundance of roast vegetables on pieces of flat bread with perfect grill marks.  It looked better than it tasted, as the only flavor that shone through was the sardine, which I normally love, but didn't love the pairing with the vegetables. 

Chicory Coffee Lacquered Texas Quail - the quail itself was quite tasty with the perfect amount of glaze.  However, the over-salt issue raised its ugly head again with the crumble that sat below the quail, which was impossible to eat.

Grilled Tournedos of Creekstone Farms Beef - perfectly cooked piece of meat with just the right amount of jus, unfortunately, someone in the kitchen decided to over salt the mushrooms and potatoes that accompanied the filet. 

Creole Bread Pudding Soufflé - again, beautiful presentation, but the taste was underwhelming, at least this dish provided us a reprieve from the onslaught of salt we experienced throughout the meal.  

We were here for a friend's birthday, they placed balloons on the table prior to our arrival, and gave her a chef's hat during the dessert course. I love the over-the-top presentation of the dishes, the gorgeous sun-filled dining room, and even the padded walls in the bathroom.  The whole restaurant is the epitome of southern charm.  Interestingly, even though we constantly had servers come by the table to take our orders, refill water glasses, take away drinks, no one bothered to ask us if we enjoyed the meal.  I guess they just took for granted that we loved everything, even when they took away our nearly full soup bowl, they didn't bother to inquire why the bowl was mostly full.  I don't think that would go unaddressed in a restaurant of this caliber in NYC.  Regardless of my quibble with the food here, I do think that it is possible for the kitchen to have an off day, and I am glad that we've had a chance to dine at this illustrious institution.",2,C6_ViNwMNnLHDbbtCwDZuA

After years of hearing my family members talk about their love affair with New Orleans, my husband and I decided to take a quick trip there to celebrate our anniversary.  Because we had a short time window of time, we decided the best way to get as much in as possible was to book a driving tour. We spoke with one of the staff at The Ritz Carlton and they took care of booking our tour with the company that most of their hotel guests have enjoyed. The time frame was perfect and everything was set.
Our driver, Lee, picked us up at the designated time, and maybe because it was the day after Easter, and people were either leaving town after the weekend, or not ready for a tour yet because they had just arrived, there were only two others on our bus... which was fantastic. 
The bus was clean, cool and the seats were very comfortable. I could see out of the windows and felt as though I was right in the middle of everything going on as we passed through Canal Street, The French Market, Lafayette Square, The Marigny, Treme, Uptown, a stop at St. Louis Cemetery #3, City Park and a bathroom break at Morning Call for beignets and a short stroll through the sculpture garden. Next we drove up City Park to the lake, heard a fascinating description of the levee system and saw the Lake View area, where almost every home had to be rebuilt after Katrina.
All the while our driver Lee was talking, he was gliding easily through city traffic. I was really impressed.  
The second half of our tour was driving through Xavier, Tulane, The Audubon, The Garden District, up St. Charles, Magazine Street, and back up Canal to our hotel.  SO MUCH TO SEE in such a short time.  It was a perfect tour for us, and Lee's love for the city and great colorful information was exceptional. 
I would highly recommend this company for a guided tour. It was easy and fun.",0,6PYPPSgZqPNvgCNCGmRmZw

I ordered the truffle and Parmesan mushroom risotto topped with prosecco crab.

I will say that the assorted mushroom quesadilla is pretty great, but everything else I've had there is pretty unimpressive & flavorless. I would not call this authentic Mexican food whatsoever.

I usually get the Miso but occasionally the Karai, when I'm in the mood for some spice.  The broth is flavorful, the pork belly melts in your mouth, the noodles are just the right texture, and the egg (extra charge) is marinated and cooked perfectly.  I think the price is fair and comparable to other ramen places I've been to.  

During our last visit we finally tried the pork belly buns... just mouth-wateringly delicious!  But, considering it's the same pork belly in the ramen ... watch out for pork belly overload.

The staff are all friendly and always pleasant, which is awesome.  Service is extremely fast!

The only drawbacks: Nom Nom continues to be cash only, which I think is somewhat unreasonable for a modern-day business, especially one in Center City; but this is just a minor inconvenience considering the quality of the food and service.  Also, make sure to specify if you'd like a glass of (free) tap water, otherwise they will charge you for bottled water - just something to keep in mind if you're living on a student's dime like me ... and especially if you come as often as I do.  =)  Lastly, on a really hot day, I wouldn't recommend coming here ... their A/C is not sufficient to keep you cool if you're just sitting there, much less while you're downing a hot bowl of broth and noodles.

When I'm in NYC, I like see where the day takes me and I do not like to be on a schedule. For years I cherished the SEPTA-NJ Transit way of doing Philly-NY business.

I am now a Bolt Bus convert. 

The Bolt Bus saves time and money. There is no getting around it. Usually you're looking at is 22.50 to $30 round trip on Bolt. That clobbers my ex-lover SEPTA-NJT's prices. I think it goes as high as $20 one way last minute. Also, the trip almost always takes exactly 2 hours. If you go at peak traffic times, this won't happen but if you can be a bit strategic, you're there in 2 hours. The quickest SEPTA-NJT goes is 2:38 and that is if everything goes exactly to plan.

The buses are new and clean.

And of course, the wireless. Pretty decent. Forget Hulu. You Tube only works if it is a music video with a single image the whole time. Streaming music such as Pandora or iMeem usually works just fine. I once sat at a seat where the electric jack didn't work but other than that, no complaints.

So if you are going from Philly to NY, it is well worth it to give Bolt Bus a chance.",10,Js4nQlGRjS1Bd5vsAQQfgA

It pains me to write that, but I've noticed the quality of the service has gone *really* downhill in my last few visits there.  The last time I went, which was about 3 months ago, was the last straw for me.

It took ages for someone to even see that people (my friend and I) were waiting to be seated.  Once we were, it took a while for the waiter to come back and take our orders, and it was not super busy the last few times we went.  From that point until the food came, the service was great.  But, as has become custom with David's anymore, after we got our platter it seemed as though the waiter vanished.  To try to get extra napkins and a refill of water was a mission!

Another thing that has become super annoying about David's is that apparently it's a tourist trap anymore.  I think my friend and I were the only locals in the place the last few times we went (especially that last time).  I wouldn't normally mind that, but these people have a tendency to ask a truckload of dumb questions (you wonder if it's the first time they've ever had Chinese food in their lives) and it does nothing but hold up already super-slow service.

And those folks also like to talk really loud about nothing at all.  You wonder if it's possible to go into David's ever again and just enjoy your meal.

Food-wise, David's has not suffered.  The food is as good as ever.  Outside of the shoddy service, it's one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the city.    I love the Hong Kong wanton soup that is simply to die for.  Their General Tso's Chicken is mouth-watering and their fried rices are cooked perfectly.

Appetizers - 
PhillyCheesesteak eggrols
udon
thai chicken wraps
pita and hummus

Main Course - 
steak
salmon
crab cakes

Sides - 
mash potatoes

Dessert - 
tangerine sorbet

Food 4/10 - Everything here you have probably experienced before. There is nothing fancy or new here. Salmon was extremely bland and lacking in flavor. crab cakes were salty, etc. Everything tasted like it was store bought. Don't expect much of the steak either. It's tiny and tastes like korean bbq(which I eat a lot so I was dissapointed)

Atmosphere 6/10 - if it wasn't so loud and full of drunk young people it'll be pretty nice but I didn't have that luxury

Service 1/10 - Extremely poor service. Waitress seemed tired and saw her maybe 3 times in the THREE HOURS we were there. I've been a server before and always give servers the benefit of the doubt but i'm pretty sure the kitchen wasn't THAT backed up that day she just entered our next course 10 min AFTER we finished our previous course.

Conclusion - If you're there for food look somewhere else. If you're there for drinks don't come here either...go to a real bar. The food tastes like store bought and service is horrendous. If you do want to give this place a shot be prepared to wait for a while for your food and poor service.",1,wgib0hvdRSrZNkEAoH7LrA

Every time I've been there I've ordered the Sabich... because not many other falafel places in the states even serve it. The eggplant is fried, but still light, and the eggs are hard boiled to perfection. It's awesome. I order it with tomatoes (I'm weird about cucumbers) and harif (hot sauce) which is extreeeeemely hot. Be careful if you're not a fan of spicy food but you want to try the harif, just order a little bit. 

The fries are decent and fresh, except sometimes they take a little while... which I suppose is worth it as the potato soaks up some of the heat from the harif. The pita is as fresh as can be, and I believe that you can order whole wheat pita! A healthful plus.

If you like middle-eastern food (for relatively cheap) give it a try. They definitely have an option for everyone.

I felt a little overwhelmed by the information the insurance/office person provided - just didn't feel like she did a good job of describing my benefits. She was very fast and whipped through my benefits like a tornado.  I caught most of it but, if you were an older person or not familiar with insurance, you probably would have felt lost.  In fact, she tried to explain a situation to an older lady who came in and ended up telling her she just needed to go back to her ophthalmologist to get a prescription..... watching it all unfold, I didn't feel like the older woman every really understood what the office staff was saying to her other than to go back to her main ophthalmologist. Even I had difficulty understanding the staff's reasoning.

I did feel like I got a comprehensive eye exam and I noticed that the staff as well as the optometrist cleaned the equipment before I was asked to put my face up to the machines... to me, that is always important since I feel that many providers skimp on this area.

They've also got a lot better merchandise, in my opinion.  That doesn't matter greatly, but I've noticed some other Second Cups lacking in that department.",2,sVr6_v-lwixu3VREOO9XpA

What truly sold me was the compassionate receptionists/vet technicians and the entire staff!! When I walked in, there was no wait what-so-ever.

I felt so shocked because I thought we were happily communicating with each other and I thought she is very professional. What a bad temper! If she couldn't stand customers giving their opinion she should said that before we started pinning! 

I asked her what did her mean that I'm difficult, I'm happy with the way she did. I think maybe she didn't mean that since she doesn't speak English well. Then she started to say my dress requires too much work and she couldn't do it, by using a rigid attitude. It's so awkward! She also said I wanted too perfectly which I wasn't. We've only started to pin 5 minutes! And now I feel it's ironic when she said that because the later on I found the store name is sew perfectly.

 I brought 4 items to sew and she didn't ask if I'd like to do other items. She didn't say goodbye when I walked out of the door. It's the worst customer experience I've ever had!

We headed to this spot after I attended a private event at the downtown location. When you go, expect a wait of some sort unless you hit it super early or after lunch. We waited probably 20-30 minutes, but it's definitely worth it. 

My husband got the stuffed French toast and said he may never have French toast any other way again! (I find he's often very quotable for my reviews!) He got an Undertow - a coffee drink that is shot-glass sized with espresso, vanilla, and cream. He loved it, and the waiter brought over a carafe of coffee for the table afterward because well, you can't live on just a small shot of espresso alone! 

My breakfast burrito was filling! I wish I had more than a butter knife to cut it with, but it was still amazing. Normally, those don't appeal to me, but if you fill it with chorizo and eggs, I can't say no! I've also had their cinnamon rolls (in a cast iron skillet) & the raspberry lemon (pan)cakes. All of them are to die for. 

The décor is light with pastel colors on the wall and fun art of various eggs. They even have egg-shaped salt & pepper shakers! The wait staff carries pepper mills so you can get fresh ground pepper any time. Pitchers of water are the norm which is great and quite a time saver! 

I had to get the screwdriver made with their ah-mazing orange juice! Yes, the OJ by itself is $3.49, but it's fresh squeezed. It's literally drinking an orange! (Well, more than one.) The owner called it the nectar of the gods, and I assure you, he's not wrong!

It's way too easy to run out for a few minutes, fill a rather large paper container full of chocolate hazelnut and plain tart frozen yogurt, sprinkle on some coconut and mochi topping, and be on my way back to my cubicle. If you haven't tried the mochi topping, give it a shot. It's a pretty fun chewy consistency and it doesn't get all frozen and hard. There's a long list of toppings from the healthy fruit toppings like strawberries and raspberries to the less healthy Butterfinger dust and Oreo pieces. 

The Kiwi website claims that they have live probiotics in all of their yogurts. Probiotics are pretty important to have every day especially in our Western diet, so I'm hoping this is true. Even if the probiotics aren't that great, the calorie count is low. I've never regretted a trip to Kiwi at the end of my lunch hour.

Be sure to ask for a couple of sample cups. That way you won't end up filling your actual cup with a mystery flavor like banana bread. If you want to try something other than the plain tart yogurt, I highly recommend the chocolate hazelnut. It's similar to Nutella but contains far fewer calories.",3,bBd8sOgkhbaEeZHjczV8ZQ

The only reason this is so is because their tempura on the rolls is too thick. The roll beneath the tempura is luxurious, melt in your mouth, beauty.

Hoping our next visit will encourage me to bump the rating up a bit. 

Atmosphere: 4. LOVED the vibe of both the inside and outside seating. Would very much like to eat there in the evening and sit outside.

Service: 2. Service was just okay. Server didn't seem overly familiar with either the food or the drink menu (or perhaps she just wasn't very interested in offering advice or recommendations for first-time diners?). Server also just seemed a little absent and confused?

Drinks: 2. The drinks tasted fine. Only fine. Not special. But they were SO DANG EXPENSIVE. I'm sorry. There is no reason for a simple margarita (and a small one!) to cost $15. It was nothing special. If and when we visit Wild Ginger again, we will skip any kind of cocktail. Seriously. The stupid cocktails pretty much ruined our entire dining experience.

Quality: 4. Food was lovely. We had the Asian Chicken Salad ($12), the Yo-Yo ($10), and the sea bass dish (from the dinner menu, $30). The food was very good. Presentation was gorgeous. I tried all three dishes--clean, nice flavor combos, quality ingredients. I'd like to try many of the other dishes.

Not that we have children or anyone in the home who needs toys, it's because we're both kids with responsibilities. 

At first we were just perusing and kind of gawking at some of the cool toys that they have in the store, when this sweet little lady walks up and starts showing us some of the stuff they have. She encouraged us to first play with a dart crossbow and shoot at the window. That was neat and provided some enjoyment for a moment. After that she picked up these big sling shot bucket looking things and pulled back on a rubber band that spat air into my face! She then handed me one and Scott one and we began with just a little war between the two of us. It was so cool to be a kid again for half a minute. That was when she drew (pun intended) our attention to the Buddha board. This thing is magic, I swear. It's some sort of rice paper mounted to a frame of some sort and there's a trough below it with a stand for a paintbrush. Inside the trough is water. If you dip the paintbrush into the water and begin to move it on the board then it writes in what looks like black ink, however after a few minutes it starts to dissipate and what you drew/wrote will vanish. It's an excellent stress reliever and a cool toy on top of it. 

This store has so much cool stuff and the employees don't care one bit if you're 10 or 100, they encourage you to let your inner child out and enjoy all the fun throughout the store.

Although my former stylist has since left, currently Veronica has been spectacular in maintaining my short, choppy hairstyle and chocolate brown color, even revamping the cut a year back to be even more flattering.  I love the location, as it was a short walk from my former apartment and I like visiting Goose the Market afterwards for a quick lamb stick treat or salmon pastrami on toast. I prefer a chair in the basement, which seems more private and has the more metallic, minimalist accents that I easily fall for.  First floor or basement, I love the overall modern design of the salon.

 I am a fairly quiet person; I think that the salon's stylists are good at picking up when you want to gossip, and when you want to stay mum and just enjoy the pampering.  Scalp, face, and hand massages, plus foot soak, are offered as perks during most haircut and color appointments, if you so desire them.  Mustachioed mugs of delicious coffee are offered.   I prefer the Aveda product offerings, especially the rosemary & mint shampoo, but the more recent introduction of Davines (especially Oi) in Veronica's styling routine has been welcome too.  I also appreciate not being aggressively pushed to buy Aveda or Davines items.  A product and its benefits may be highlighted during the styling process, but there is no hard sell at the end. 

 After coloring, I don't experience that chemical, over-processed feeling, and the color lasts longer than prior salons I've visited; this, plus all the added perks and great service, make the price worth it.  I highly recommend Veronica and would expect all of Salon Orange Moon's stylists to be just as competent and savvy.",10,JuCgoHYJww70wX9M8ndKnQ

This Saturday, though, I DO remember. We started with the ""spicy crispy calamari"" with goat cheese, spicy cherry peppers, and arugula as well as the lobster bisque. The calamari was the best tasting I've ever had. It was perfectly spicy and the goat cheese was a great compliment to it. I do wish the calamari was a little more crispy than it was, but it still tasted amazing. The lobster bisque also was declicious. We each were swapping our apps back and forth to one another until there was nothing left :(

For dinner I got the lamb chop with swiss chard and roasted potatoes. It came with a red wine sauce and the plate was circled in a pesto sauce. It was really good. The best bites were the ones where I got a little bit of everything on the plate on my fork and ate it all at once. My man got the sea urchin pasta. The pasta was black with squid ink and was complimented with sea urchin and crab meat. I wasn't a huge fan of the dish, just because it kind of creeped me out, but it didn't taste bad or anything. It tasted, to me, like the ocean - salty! He loved it, though. And now he gets to say that he's had sea urchin, which was the main reason he chose the dish.

For dessert I got the nutella crepes. I was disappointed, mostly because I love Beau Monde's nutella crepes, and they're really not the same. The ones at Positano Coast were stuffed with nutella, raspberries, and hazelnuts. I didn't like the nuts. The side of ice cream was chocolate with more nuts. Meh. My husband got the dulce du leche gelato, which came in a mini-waffle bowl. That, I must say, was very good.

Overall the meal was delicious. We had planned on staying for the open bar that went from 9:30 pm - 2 am, leaving in between to watch the fireworks, but we never went back after the fireworks. The music/atmosphere was not what I expected from this place. It was very Euro-trash, techno. Quite weird. We were looking for more of a relaxing night out.

My friend had the chicken salad tartine, which is snooty for open faced toast. If there was half a cup of chicken salad smeared on the toast I'd be shocked and add another side of limp lettuce and ring up another $12.

They have the cold bar with Mango and it is amazing.  On the hot side the Pakora is spot on and Naan is great too. The Goat curry is delicious. My fave is the Chicken Tika Masala. Very very good. The service is good. I have been helped by the young woman there. She is very attentive and makes sure that water and or Tea is always filled. Don't get scared of the decor and atmosphere.

I have been wanting to try this place ever since they opened and since my favorite soul food place that was on Broadway closed. Shanaz is kind of tucked away in a strip mall off of Main Street in Meridian across the street from Meridian Speedway. Careful because if you are not looking for it closely you could easily pass by it and that would be a shame. 

I came at the tail end of their lunch hours but was greeted nonetheless with a warm welcome.  Bob Marley music was at a nice volume and really set the mood for what would be a really nice experience. I mean who doesn't like Marley, right?

I ended up ordering a Korean taco which I know sounds strange for a soul food place. And a shrimp Po Boy sandwich with a salad instead of fries and their house sesame dressing. Topped it off with a sweet tea. 

The Korean taco was really good and even better was the jalapeño sauce that came with it. The meat was flavored just right and if I didn't have a sando coming I could've easily had three more. 
The salad was one of my favorite things traditional but has crunchy fried onions on top and with that house dressing I could've seriously just dunked straight veggies in it, it's that good. 
The sweet tea is very sweet and was missing the traditional lemon wedge on the top to make it truly southern in this humble gal's opinion but no worries ask and you shall receive!  I was brought a couple of wedges on the side. I am sure if I would've added more ice it would've been perfect! 
The Shrimp PO boy sandwich was great and served with a lemon wedge but was missing hot sauce to add as an option when I asked for hot sauce options I was offered tapatio or cholula...what?? Which would be my only real criticism. A soul food place should have either a signature hot sauce or a wall of hot sauces that are typical to the style of cooking. Not to worry I always make the best of what I've got. I had some of the jalapeño sauce left over from my taco and tried it on the sandwich and BOOM!! It was awesome! So with another side of that sauce it transformed my shrimp po boy from good to the bomb!  Yeah I think I've said it before I like my stuff spicy. ;-)

Curtis was an amazing server!! He refilled my drink at the right times, answered questions to the best of his knowledge and checked on my status often.  I will definitely be returning to Shanaz for some more of its soul!! Yes!",2,bg5Ow7ihoopeD9g4Tnbagw

After I placed my order (to go), I took a look around...the place was filthy, flies everywhere, including in the sorry-looking condiments bar. The experience went downhill from there.

1. The fountain Diet Coke was totally flat. When I mentioned it (nicely) to the lady who took my order, she said she tried it earlier and it was fine. She looked at the CO2 canister, confirmed it was ""fine,"" and that was it. I told her (again, nicely) the soda was undrinkable and requested a refund, which she gave me.

2. When my order was almost done, the woman cooking behind the counter shouted out that she was out of spicy fries, and that if I wanted to wait another 5 minutes, she would make more. She went on to say that she got the order wrong because the woman who wrote the order did not write clearly. (What??? Taking orders by hand and not double-checking them??) I said no problem, just give me regular fries.

3. This is the kicker...when I got the order home, I was shorted a kid's meal hamburger. I got a pile of fries in a box, but no burger to go along with it. Plus a half order of spicy fries that tasted like they were cooked hours before. By then I was fuming.....I had a sick husband at home and two hungry kids...hard to tell one of the kids, ""ooops! No burger for you!"" I called the store and asked for the manager, expecting at least a courteous reply to my problem. ""Oh, I can give you a burger if you come back."" No apology. I asked for a refund -- ""I'm not authorized to do that."" I asked to speak to her boss, who ""wasn't in tonight."" I asked that he call me back, which ""Dan"" never did. 

TERRIBLE customer service, NO attention paid by workers to getting the order right, FILTHY establishment. There are too many places to eat in West County to have to go to Christy's. 

I will revise this review if ""Dan"" ever calls me back, though I am not holding my breath.",5,r9_1mYTbtZzXml9gkkBsnQ

Oliver A Bistro succeeds in providing elevated home styled comfort food.  The menu might be slightly limited but there are great appetizers, seafood, burgers and comfort entrees on the menu.

The mussels appetizer in Thai Coconut sauce was excellent.  The mussels were fresh and plump.  The buttered bread on top was toasted perfectly and great for dipping.  I could have used more bread for dipping but otherwise this was perfect.  The portion was great as well, good enough for 4.

The truffle mushroom bruschetta was awesome.  Plated on top of a bed of arugula, there was ample parm and mushroom on top.  One slice could be enough for two.  This was delicious.

The meatloaf entree was generous.  The meatloaf was awesome and seasoned well with mashed potatoes and green beans on the side.  

The shrimp and grits entree was a bit heavy with ample cheddar on top.  Given that I'm not a big grits fan I should have probably chosen a different entree.  The shrimp that surrounded the grits was perfect.  While I didn't finish the grits, I loved the shrimp.

I'd also like to call out Oliver A Bistro for one key business practice.  Their operating hours say they close at 8:30pm and that's when the last seating takes place.  I was there well past 8:30pm and nobody rushed us out.  In fact there were several other diners there after we left.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine when a restaurant states they close at a later hour but the kitchen closes two hours earlier.

The spices, the sauces, even the vegan dishes are amazing. I get food to go from here maybe once a month. It's located at state and glenwood, not far from my house. I have even become a regular. Every time I call or go in, I'm greeted with a friendly, ""Hey Mike, how are you?"" I prefer chicken tikka masala, but everything is so damn good!

Chicken tikka masala is ""boneless marinated chicken cooked in a thick curry sauce with fresh tomatoes, onions, bell peppers and coriander leaves"". Similarly to Thai restaurants, you can up the spice level 1-5 depending on how much you like your food to make you sweat. I usually stay right around 3. Perfect level of heat for me. I always get some sort of naan to go along with it. Naan is a flat bread baked in a clay oven. In my opinion it's perfect when there is a bit of char on the bread.

If you have never had Indian food before, go for lunch when they have their buffet. I know that doesn't sound very appealing, but trust me. It's not your typical Asian or chuck wagon style buffet.

Unprofessional, not calling to tell me that my service repair was going to take 12 hours longer than expected.

Full story: I dropped my car off (with an appointment made ahead of time) on a Friday, 10a to get the timing belt replaced. They were pretty busy, understandable, but when I was getting checked in the person helping me told me that he would try to get my car finished by closing that night. Worst case scenario, he asked if it was ok to hold my car until the next morning. I told him it wouldn't be ideal (I expected that if I had made an appointment ahead of time, it would get taken care of that day!), but that worst case scenario I could be flexible as long as I could get my car back by noon Saturday. He said great, took down my phone number, said he'd be in touch!

Friday closing rolls by, no phone call. Disappointed, I assume I'll hear back Saturday morning. Saturday morning, I wait until 10a (service center opens at 8a), and then I call them. I talk to someone who is very confused, they tell me they'll call me right back. Forty-five minutes go by, I don't hear back, so I call again. I talk to another employee, she says she'll call me back. This employee actually does call me back, says they'll have my car done by 3/4pm. This is supremely disappointing, because I had planned on having a vehicle back by noon, and it had impacts on my weekend plans. 4pm comes by, I call them again, and they say that my car still isn't done: they were waiting on a part they needed, which had only come in at 3:45. Now my car won't be done until 5:30pm. If I had been told about the delay HOURS earlier, I could have adapted my plans more easily, but instead I was basically waiting by the phone all day for a car that should have been at the shop no later than noon. 

Basically: why bother asking me about my schedule/timeline if you won't even call bother to call me back when there is a delay? Incredibly unprofessional and obnoxious.",3,UFtZmKpO-hvyRzOTr6Gunw

The tiramisu was frozen as I but into the center of the cake. You could tell it was not a popular item because it probably came out of the freezer.

I like the owner and respect what she is trying to do. Judging by the 45 minute lines coupled with the ridiculously inflated prices, I'd say she is 'Doing business right'. And that's America, you charge what the market will bear. 

The bagels: outstanding, and a bargain. 
Everything else: pretty good but truly priced out of this market. 

Seriously the pricing is obnoxious and it's not just that. I was in there a month ago in line behind a guy who said he was also a New Yorker. He asked for a 1/4 lb. of a few things that were sold BY WEIGHT... The owner (rather obnoxiously) said 'we don't do that' and would only do 1/3 lb. then said something to the effect of 'you're from NYC you know how we do things!' I was 2 people back and heard the whole thing play out crystal clear. 

But therein lies the rub. This is not New York City. This is Nashville, Tennessee. I was with one other person and with just two bagels, cream cheese, lox, and coffee, our bill was over $35!!! That is INSANITY for Nashville.

So many things to do! It's not a huge park but it's jam packed!

We found staff to be very helpful and friendly. Even when we didn't ask, they offered information and advice. It saved us time. I'd like to give a special shout out to Danielle who sought out my husband when he lost his prescription sunglasses. 
They had salad and fruit options that allowed me not to totally blow my diet. 
3 of us ate lunch for $27. Not too shabby for a theme park. The food also wasn't awful. Better than the meals I've had at BG. 
There are bathrooms everywhere! Helpful with a small child. 
Life jackets available in all sizes! Also helpful with a small child.

During the most recent trips to this particular Lowe's location, we have made a purchase of a washer and dryer set and the associate who helped us was great.  They do deliver for free and install the appliance(s) for you.  It took around 1.5 weeks from purchase for delivery to take place. Probably because it was close to Thanksgiving and they have some great prices on several different appliances which meant more people making purchases.

The actual transaction went smoothly. He made sure we purchased everything needed for the installation and had the paperwork ready for checkout.  He was also very chatty and friendly.  Other things were purchased after walking around the store for a little bit (including some cabinet liners and some basic white paint) and everything went well.

He told me Maplewood does and that was that. He did not even wait until I can ask him about my second choice.

The rooms were decent but not the feel of a resort.  The pool and hot tub were nice but also didn't have much of a resort feel.  Nothing else about the property would I even include in a description of a resort.  So I'm not sure why they call it one.  I was even disappointed in the casino - no Craps?!

I really loved that a lot of the scenery was reminiscent of the Cincinnati area where I grew up. There are hills here. We also encountered a bunch of trees that had orange leaves (they were actually changed for the season) and another with purple leaves (it looked like that may be the color of that tree. I am not sure). We walked towards the adjacent neighborhood and found a small man-made dam and a sad memorial. It is a pretty neat place to explore. Stop to read the park rules at the entrance. They gave us a giggle. 

I will be back to this park again to explore farther. I mostly stayed on the north side of the trail and did not go back around the lake behind the apartments. I will sometime soon though. I would definitely recommend this park as a great place to connect with nature.",3,CaVEy7kpASLwNBGymLwhgw

OMG.  This beach is so much fun to come to.  I'm sure I'd come here even if I didn't have a furry friend to accompany me.   But as the only public-access and Dog-friendly beach in Santa Barbara, it's heaven for our four-legged companions.    
The beach is actually called ""Arroyo Burro"", but al the locals will forever know it as ""Hendry's Beach.""
It's designed so that as you descend the stairs to the beach, you have the option of turning left and walking over a small wash.  If you chose to turn right, you will have entered the part of the beach designed for PEOPLE only.  However, if you turn LEFT and cross over the small wash, you can take your dog OFF-LEASH.   
I smile ear-to-eat when I come here.   The dogs run full speed and ""smile"" ear-to-ear as they socialize together.    Dogs dart in and out of the water.   It's just hysterical to watch.   I'd even come here to watch them if I didn't own a dog....it always makes me smile and elevates my day.   It's so nice that SB has this precious gem as access for our pets.   Many places do not. 
They also have a dog wash station (nominal fee) as you exit  the parking lot, so you can clean your ""creatures"" before you head home. 
The public restrooms are clean and you can wash your feet off at the top of the stairs after leaving the beach.  
If you should find yourself hungry while visiting, don't forget to check out ""The Boathouse"" for  fresh seafood selections (just be advised that they do have a dress code and you cannot simply wear your shorts and bathing suit).",3,Ej1QkmrOsVsaTyaDBDxTWA

Beer cheese dip- the waiter said it was often ordered. It tasted like canned nacho cheese to me. Came with a pretzel that was fluffy though. 

Chicken salad sandwich, a bit dry and the coleslaw was weirdly thick and too sweet. Probably would not recommend this combo. 

Mac and cheese burger- burger cooked PERFECT. Ordered medium rare and the correct amount of pink in the middle. Tender. Ordered salt & pepper chips as the side (regular from a bag I assume) but I love me some chips so no issues in my book.

We went in, asked to sit outside, and then was directed through the dining area to the patio.  The inside looked cool in passing and I will have to go another time to sit and take in the sites.

The hostess at the patio entrance greeted us quickly and seated us quickly as well.  Our waitress came over, dropped off menus and asked if we wanted any drinks.   When my friend asked for a cocktail menu the waitress without saying a word, took the menu out of my friends hand, flipped it over and handed it back.  Not the most friendly interaction.

Soon, she appeared with our drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  We ordered and as she walked away I asked her name.  I hate saying 'hey you' or something to that affect.  She replied and headed over to another table.

Our food did not take that long.  It was good too!  I got the stew in a bowl (trying to watch carbs), one friend got a Ruben while the other a side salad and wings.  We all really liked what we got.   The waitress did come back once during the meal to check on us.  

The sad part was waiting for her to bring the check.  She was working a few other tables but never checked in.  I finally had to speak her name loudly to get her attention.  We eventually got our checks and since it took so long to get them we decided to pay cash.  We could not wait for a credit card transaction.

I really wanted to give this place 4 or 5 stars but the service killed it for me.  It wasn't busy at all.  She just didn't seem to be very interactive this evening.

We ordered the mushroom arancini, garlic bread, meatballs, braised lamb pasta (can't remember exact name), and pan seared gnocchi. 

Great things: Easy to make a reservation, space is beautiful and romantic, and there's a simple menu with lots of options. Pan seared gnocchi was excellent and the sauce and vegetables and nuts mixed in was incredible -- easily best thing we ate. Meatballs were pretty good as well, nothing that knocked my socks off but they're definitely housemade and great for sharing.

Not so great things: Atmosphere was super loud, also very crowded -- we were seated in the back room and even scooted all the way into our seats, the dining area felt far too cramped. Waitstaff was nice enough, but felt cold and detached from the whole experience, not super welcoming on the hospitality side. Mushroom arancini came at the recommendation of several raving yelp reviews -- was just not impressed by this. Was kind of one dimensional in flavor even with the fragrant truffle oil. 

More not so great things: Garlic bread came super burnt, and had to be sent back. Waitstaff was kind and brought out a new one that was much better, but they shouldn't have brought it out burnt in the first place. Second serving was much improved, more butter and garlic flavor. Roasted head of garlic was excellent! The braised lamb pasta was truly a disappointment. I tried a piece of lamb, which was super salty, and then went in for a piece of pasta, which had zero flavor except being super salty. I didn't get another bite because it was just too much. Waitress was kind enough to comp the pasta, and I appreciated that, but I was so disappointed in the dish.

Overall, was super disappointed in the experience -- this place was hyped up by so many people and I was a bit embarrassed bringing my dad here while he's visiting from out of town and calling this place one of the best Italian restaurants the city has. It definitely fell short of that label and despite the good things, the experience was highly mediocre and underwhelming -- I probably wouldn't return.",0,JxEMhujdTF-313z-u0hjGw

Scammed me on my lease buyout!

Charged me $500 for a full inspection, then gave me perhaps the highest rate possible on the loan with an 800+ credit score. Their tactic here was make me wait over an hour to sign 80% of the paperwork on an iPad and then use small talk to keep my mind off this terrible deal he had to digitally prepare for 2 hours like they'd never done one before...

They then told me to bring my car in under warranty to replace the rear wheel bearings. I drove the car off the lot and immediately had brake pad vibrations. Meanwhile the service desk is trying to tell me that although they did a $500 inspection they missed the brake pads or the rain rusted them during the 2 days of training the car sitting in their service lot.

Obviously, like any crooks, they want to charge me 350$ for 2 new brake pads IF I decide to get them fixed OR 80$ for doing another inspection because they messed something up...

These people have sleazy tactics and practices. I watched them prey on elders by looking strung out and overly stressed. They weren't too busy to request a great rating several times over for their sleazy service... 

Every question was countered with a contrasting broad answer/argument to distract the customer from the real problem... The highway robbery prices, unethical service technicians and service reps with zero human touch minus the pull-string responses programmed in their soulless meat sack bodies. 

I never got any understanding or sympathizing. Only tactically timed responses and free car wash coupon that was good for a week...

Security sucks, it's literally just kids that live there that they hired to work so they don't do anything and don't care. It's loud 24/7. My main thing was the people. The people at beach city are from another breed, some people you have never thought to ever encounter and than suddenly you're mashed up all with them and living with the scum bags. These people DO NOT care about you or your things or anything quite frankly. They are all selfish all crazy alcoholic drug addicts/dealers. I seriously am not over exaggerating.

Kien Giang specializes in Asian groceries and gifts, of which most are primarily Vietnamese. It is a fairly sized market that has enough to keep you looking for a while.

When you walk in you get those unique smells of products from various countries of Asia mixed together. On the right side is a mini produce section with vegetables and fruits to choose from. On the left side is where you get everything else. Lots of caned food, various noodles, spices and sauces, drink mixes, and other items to make your meals. There is even a small area where they sell dvds and music. It was so interesting to see Korean Drama dvds on sale as well, even though the titles and language was translated to Vietnamese. So if you need to find ingredients for that special Vietnamese dish then I definitely recommend this place, but they do not offer much products for the other Asian cultures out there.

If you move in, make sure to use the roofdeck.  The seating out there is surprisingly comfortable and the view isn't bad.  The only downside to this place is the location.

For starters, I almost did not dine there because they had the air conditioner off in the middle of August in South Louisiana... 

We decided to sit at the hibachi table to get lunch hibachi along with a sushi roll. The salad that comes with the hibachi was wonderful, lots of salad and lots of dressing. The soup was very bland, I would honestly believe it was just tap water and not a broth with like two or three noodles in it. 

Then I got my dynamite roll which was at room temperature, and did not taste fresh at all. However, the rolls were stuffed with fish and fairly big rolls which was great. I would probably order the sushi again if I came for hibachi but I would not come specifically for sushi, there is much better within a close proximity.

I ordered the hibachi shrimp and chicken which comes with fried rice and stir-fried vegetables. The shrimp and vegetables were cooked to perfection. The chicken was very overcooked and dry, making it fairly unpleasant to eat. I only ate it because I was hungry and I am not picky at all. The fried rice could have used more soy sauce for my preference but wasn't below average. 

The wait staff was very attentive from the beginning, making sure my glass did not get below half way. They took dirty dishes away right as you finished, even with every hibachi table in the place full and being used as well. I gotta say I was impressed with the wait staff. The hibachi chef was also great, he was funny and did all the tricks of the trade when you eat hibachi. The routine onion train, squeaking chicken, spatula flips, and egg flips.

You can't and should not change perfection. When they first opened we all called the Lolis tacos ""crack tacos"" because you craved them all the time! There was just something about these tacos that had you waiting in a 30 min line. Anyone who knows me knows that patience is not one of my virtues, so waiting is not something I do unless you're that special. After about a year something had changed. I came in over and over seeking that first hit...and it was gone. 

Lolis has since redeemed themselves and I can definitely say these are the best tacos and sopes you can get on the West side of town. They may not be the same crack tacos they were in the very humble beginning, but they are mighty close. So they've changed something again, but this time for the good.

I have been receiving emails from black fish for take out throughout the Covid-19 crisis and unfortunately have not been able to make it happen until last night. I just did it! I ignored all of my families Idiosyncrasies  and ordered for my self. Boy was I glad I did. My family was super happy too! 
     The meal was perfectly packed with all the fixings of a gourmet Mexican feast. We even has a little container of shredded lettuce and limes for a garnish and zest. The meal might sound super simple and it was, but each and every element was presented ""just so"" in true BLACK FISH fashion and it was perfect.  
        We absolutely loved the salmon ceviche. By the time we ate it, all the flavors were 'married' nicely. The fresh salmon was pretty ""cooked"" and still had the freshness of a freshly tossed ceviche. The presentation in the container was delightful too! The take out worked! 
        The salsas were wonderful! The bright green guacamole was over packed and disappeared pretty quickly with the yummy tortilla chips. My daughter exclaimed that the chips were the best she had ever had. She is my up and coming foodie. We loved the simplicity of the pork taquerias that had yummy flavors, and were crispy but not dry. The heating instructions were spot on. I enjoyed plating my meal with all the fixings and yes the lettuce gave that extra special fresh palate pleasing  crunch. Black fish remembers the extra special nibbles that makes everything pop.  I really appreciated the details. 
      Typically, I would not write anything about red beans and rice... I mean what could there be said about this standard? In this case, lots could be said. This side dish was perfectly prepared and seasoned beautifully,it heated up very very well was tender and flavorful. The best I have ever had, ever! 
        Tres Lechese desert was a delight. I had no Idea what I was getting into, for once I did not google the offering before It came out of the pack. I was pleasantly surprised to find a wonderful coconut cake swimming in a super sweet yummy milky custard sauce. It was thrilling! A simple spring treat after our yummy satisfying dinner. 
     All these elements combined made me so super happy with my Cinco de Mayo meal. My family members were also stoked with the delicious meal too!!!
        I have been ordering from restaurants during this stay at home directive and have had mixed reviews, but am excited to report that the 'heat at home program' from BlackFish was the best restaurant ""take out"" so far. I am looking forward to doing this program more often. 
      Keep a Look out for their weekly dinner options and  I will see you in the Car line in Conshohocken!
(Fyi: I breezed into Conshohocken with no traffic what so ever, parked in front of the restaurant with ease behind another patron.  (It was fun to feel like I was party of the Black Fish foodie club) The system was seamless. Frederick was there to greet and load out trunks with goodies.

We went late on Friday night with another couple (8pm reservations) & we had our pick of seats!  We sat upstairs in the slightly raised area (previously the altar, maybe?), with a view of the whole room.  What was nice to see was that for a more romantic setting, there were cozy couches that you could sit NEXT to your date and view the entire room as you enjoyed dinner. Can't wait to try this next time - looks like the perfect date-table!

We ordered a variety of things, and each one was better than the next! My husband and I shared a wedge salad (we were TRYING not to overeat) at the start of the meal, and honestly the 1/2 portion was plenty big (and perfectly delish)!  The bread on the table was served warm with butter, and it was heavenly!

For dinner he ordered the scallops, and I ordered the steak.  We switched midway through the meal (#sharing #marriagegoals) and the even though the scallops were PERFECT, I was sad to part with the filet.  It was cooked perfectly, flavored amazingly, and served with garlic mash and asparagus. YUM-MY.  We also purchased a relatively decent priced bottle of wine for the 4 of us, the waiter was very helpful about respecting our budget and suggesting a good wine.  

Note.  We plotted and planned our meal so we could stay for dessert, as I've heard epic things about this place.  Unfortunately we were SO full that we had to leave and didn't order anything.  Hoping to come back soon (perhaps, after skipping lunch...) to try again, and make it to dessert!

It was extremely rude and I called and asked to talk to the hotel manager, since he would know what delivery company that was, and I could file a complaint with him. I was told I would get a call back, that he was on the other line. I never received a call back, which tells me that the manager could care less about my future business.

We started with the grilled shrimp, which upon initial review seemed basic, but the dish had layers of complexity which I cannot even put into words. Then we each had salads (Romaine, Kale/Spinach), which were phenomenal. Next, I inhaled a short rib with fettuccine, whilst my spouse had the halibut - we both inhaled our entrees with great joy.

The location is not that bad. Its in the shopping center where Ross and Big Lots reside.

THE FOOD: 
Let me start out by saying that my grandfather was of Chinese decent and was founder of a great Chinese restaurant in the Philippines. I don't expect Chinese restaurants here to measure up to that but I do expect some decency.  The food at this place was well below par. I felt that I would have been better off heating up some food from the Freezer section of WalMart and it would have been MUCH better than this. I figured I would get something simple for my first visit to see how the chef does...I ordered Chicken and Broccoli. When it came out, the sauce was still congealed from not being heated up enough. The saucy was overly salty and had no other flavors other than salt. 

THE SERVICE: 
The service was well below what you expect at least a mid-level restaurant to be. It took them way too long to take our order and then refills were extremely slow. I usually base a service on whether they let you get thirsty or not....this place didn't disappoint....they kept you thirsty.

The burger itself was delicious, we both asked for medium rare, and the Burgers were cooked just right, if not more on the rare side. The meat is fresh and the toppings,tomatoes,onions,pickles are generous.
The only reason I did not give five stars, is I think they lost our order. Tables around us were served before us. I think they realized the mistake and quickly got dinner out. They took our drinks off the bill for having to wait so long. I feel sorry for the wait staff because it is insanely busy.

The next time we go there we're in the plaza looking for something to eat I figured we'd have a steak sub of course the owner is bragging how amazing their Steak Subs are and how he's the best chef in in the entire world but never once does the words outer from his mouth guaranteed to be satisfied. We had our service dog with us, while we were waiting on our food to be prepared we went  to the pet store to get a few things, when we came back in the owner greeted us outside, wanted to take my card inside to pay for the food gave us the impression that our dog was not allowed. Wait what it's our service animal and I proceeded in the door to pick up my food got a very cold shoulder and a dirty look from everybody working. I said then I would never go back if my service animal was not welcome then I didn't want to be there either so this time is the final time that I will go to this establishment I ordered a meatball sub and I figured I'd get a slice of pizza because I knew that his Subs were not that large so I purchased a meat lovers, they charged me 399 for a slice of pizza yes $3.99 for a slice of pizza so I didn't complain I just assumed hey this is going to be one amazing slice of pizza. Too funny it was so barren I've seen corn dogs that had more meat than this slice of pizza it looked like he uses a meat slicer and cuts his meat thin like deli meat it so thin that it resembled deli meat and then dices it into little squares and lightly and I do mean lightly sprinkles it sparingly over the pizza. very disappointing, and as I've already stated the meatball sub is mediocre, the sauce is bitter, he can't even spring to add a little bit of cheese to make it look nice. He takes his meatballs and cuts them in about quarter to half inch thick slices and lines the entire sandwich so you get about 1/3 pound of meat  at best on a 12 inch sub not cool. I've got to say that I only gave this place one star because I could not give it a negative five and I hope that this review helps inform others if you want a meatball sub in the area just go to Firehouse. Their sub is 110 times better and cheaper then this establishment. If you want good pizza go anywhere else and you will be more satisfied. If you want good pizza, New York style, Jersey, go to Eddie and Sam's downtown Tampa Amazing Pizza prices are very fair you will love this establishment, the atmosphere is great, and the people are very friendly, and it's very fast service. My suggestion is that this owner should go to other establishments in the area and Sample their foods to know how his food Stacks up against theirs",1,BWJoR3i_98lvhVCetLXuFg

I had been here in the past and was happy with the food and service, so I thought would be a nice option since it is local and we had a coupon for $12 off.  We made a reservation, which was not necessary since we walked into an almost empty restaurant.  The front room was warm and, luckily, there were tables in the back with air conditioning.  There were a few other tables of diners, but they were nowhere close to being packed.  My boyfriend tells me that this restaurant was purchased in the late 80's or early 90's and it looks it.  I doubt it has been redecorated since it was purchased.  The walls, carpet, tables, lighting, and centerpieces are dated.  There is some modern art on the walls, but it looks out of place.  We noticed that our water glasses were mismatched, which we found odd. The waitress took our order and brought out bread.  The bread was warm and seemed fresh, but when I reached in the basket to grab some butter, I pulled out an open, partially used butter packet.  We brought it to the waitress' attention and she didn't seem fazed by it at all.  I still don't know if we were served bread left over from someone else.  The oil/pesto mix and cheese for our bread, once we received it, was rather enjoyable.  Our meals began with salad, which was a standard salad.  I ordered capellini Neptune which is scallops and shrimp over capellini pasta in a lobster cream sauce.  I have ordered this in the past and have enjoyed it.  The meal was satisfactory although the shrimp were a little rubbery and I could have done with a little less sauce.  My boyfriend ordered steak medium rare and it came out medium well.  We were pressed for time so we didn't want to send it back, but when we told the waitress, her reply was, ""what would you like me to do?""  We asked for the manager, but it turns out the manager is the owner and also the chef, so he was busy cooking for the other diners (some other parties had come in the front dining room by now).  We were offered a dessert to make up for the steak, which we took to-go.  We asked for a refill of bread during the meal, which we never received.   The prices are on the high side for the area, and for what you get for your money.  Based on the crowd for a Saturday night, I don't know how this place stays in business.

Sonobana is both a market and a restaurant. They have different hours. We stopped by in the afternoon - the market was open, but the restaurant wasn't opening for a few more hours (we came back). 

The market is great. They have everything from frozen foods to refrigerated foods (including some sushi-grade fish and other items if you want to make some sushi at home) to rice seasonings to condiments to candies and baked goods. It's small, but it has a lot to offer if you like to cook or snack! If I lived nearby, I'd probably shop here pretty often (anytime I was trying a Japanese or Japanese-inspired recipe)! 

The restaurant is old school when it comes to takeout. You call and make an order. This place is under the radar popular, and you might be put on hold. During COVID, there is sometimes a line out the door - but it moves quickly. A lot of people in line are just in line to check in for food pickup - you go in and tell them your name; if your order is ready, you're done; if it's not ready, they ask that you wait outside and they'll bring it out to you. I called at 5:00, and it took a bit of time to order since I was on hold before I could place my order. They asked for about 30 minutes to get our order together, and it took a bit long (less than 10 minutes). In today's takeout/delivery market, I'm totally happy to call and place orders the old fashioned way if it means that the restaurant keeps more/all of the profits, but just wanted to give everyone a heads up about how takeout works here!

But the food! Everything was delicious. Here's the important things to know: the menu is large and varied. They offer sushi (some people would say the best in Nashville), but they also offer a variety of other Japanese dishes and specialties (cutlets, sukiyaki, soba, udon, and so on). We ordered a bit of everything. 

We started with the otsuke mono (assorted pickled) and pork wasabi syumai (these were both great small starters to the meal and I'd order both again). We also got the Chasoba (cold green tea soba noodles with sauce), which was a great cold noodle dish (green tea soba noodles!!!). We also tried one of their three ochazuke options (ochazuke is a dish made by pouring green tea or dashi or hot water over cooked rice with various toppings) - the shake chazuke with salted broiled salmon; which was so simple and delicious. And, of course, a sushi combo! We got the Matsu combo (nigiri of tuna, yellowtail, egg, shrimp, octopus, white fillet, salmon, smelt roe, and surf clam, plus a tuna roll). Yes to this sushi. 

The food was all great. I don't think I ordered a single thing I wouldn't order again. And there's so much more on the menu I want to try: beef negima, yamakake udon, eel bowl, tofu steak, broiled sanma, yellowtail collar/neck...!

Sonobana is definitely a spot that is well known to locals (especially if they're from West Nashville). I'm sad it took me so long to figure out that it is amaaaaazing. Check it out.",10,h7p-GuaHFGsiKCF4g6Bjqg

The bento box comes with 4 pieces of California roll, 2 shrimp Shumai, fried veggie rice, and your selected protein choice. All lunch specials come with a miso soup and salad with ginger dressing. My personal favorite sushi combo is the spicy tuna, veggie roll (cucumber, asparagus, avocado- aka a vegetarian Cali roll), and the shrimp tempura roll.

This is one of the worst haircuts I have ever had in my life. Nothing I said was listened to. My hair was cut shorter and shorter until basically it's an uneven buzz cut. On top of that after I was already in the chair I heard two employees openly bitching about a customer who had just walked out the door. 

I requested a cut with a four on the sides and the clipper length at the end is closer to a two, and this happened fast before I could stop anything. 

I wasn't asked how I wanted my sideburns, they were just cut uneven, and near the beginning of the haircut which is odd, usually this happens near the end. 

I wasn't asked how I wanted the hair above my ears cut, two uneven white sidewalls. 

Hair just fell in my face and I sat like that with my eyes closed for about five minutes until the employee drops his comb and I brushed all of that hair out of my face with my own hand.  

I asked for care to be taken near my temples and they were buzzed to the scalp, and this will take six months to grow back. 

The only thing I was asked before being butchered was whether I wanted the back rounded or squared. I asked for it to be rounded and natural and now I have one side which is rounded and one side which is square which I have to try and fix looking into a mirror backwards while sitting on my own sink.

The location is nestled in the back of the parking lot so I ended up driving around the stupid roundabout twice (my bad) but I did eventually find it. The reception area is clean and well-lit with modern decor; very stark, and not my bag but for those who really like the minimalist look, I could see the appeal. 

We were greeted by the front desk guy, Jay, who was super silly and friendly. He did great with my daughter (5 years old) and before we left they were old friends. Full of quips and puns, this guy will either get you smiling within minutes or annoy the hell out of you depending on your mood. Since it's not PMS time, smiling-in-minutes was my choice. 

In my opinion, the selection of frames offered sat well with the whole ""minimalist"" feel of the store so it was small and if my little one had needed glasses, I may have gone elsewhere for the frames; not a lot of kid choices. That being said, neither me nor my daughter needed glasses so...nevermind. Nix this entire paragraph. 

Moving on. Dr. Ryan had an easy way about him, introducing himself to my daughter as an individual rather than greeting only me and acknowledging her with a nod (something we get a lot of). Points for that. We turned down the dilation (we only do it every other year) and there was no pressure or frown lines on his face. 

The exams went quickly and again, his skill with children was evident. When she got squirrely while I got my exam done, he got her some magna tiles to keep her entertained. For me, I'm an adult so I can kinda suck it up if the professional is less than stellar; but with my daughter, because we are establishing good habits with dental and eye checkups on schedule it is important to me that the person working with her is GOOD with her. Dr. Ryan fit that bill nicely. Bonus? Picking from the treasure chest after the exam (for my daughter, not me).

Overall, a great place to get your annual exam. We'll definitely be back next year!",4,T4qW77JPwhE_FywXP8PdLQ

This third generation family owned and operated candy store has been in Boise for 75 years and Curtis, who is rightfully proud of the family's contributions of good things to the community, is getting to the age where he is thinking about moving on if he found someone who wanted to carry on the legacy of quality and care that is hallmark at Lee's.  So perhaps this review is to say timing can be everything, and the time is right with Valentine's Day coming up, to go in and buy some of Lee's delectable, handmade chocolates for your sweetie...or yourself.  And with the multitude of celebration events just ahead - St. Pat's, Passover, Easter, Mother's Day, graduation season, Father's Day, wedding season - there are plenty of ways to give and enjoy these luscious creations.   But anytime is the right time to say ""you're special to me"" to someone with top quality chocolate like this.

THE TREATS:  They have plenty to choose from in both light and dark (our fav) chocolates and the ones we bought were as wonderfully fresh and perfectly sweet but not cloyingly so of any we have enjoyed. (Highly recommend the dark chocolate covered walnut nougat.)   And don't miss the Almond Toffee, if you're a fan of that delight as we are, because this one has a generous coating of almonds they roast and salt right in house.  Among the best we have ever eaten and we have eaten a lot of it across the years.  And if you know someone who loves nuts they have a deluxe nut mix that they roast in house and sell too.  They also sell novelty candies and foil wrapped candies that they don't make in house for a full complement of old fashioned candy store appeal.  

THE SERVICE:  Maybe the second most special thing in addition to the wonderful chocolates that so exceeded our expectations was the friendly, warm service from the woman at the counter.  Sweeeeet!

THE VIBE:  Sparkling clean and bright, it smells good when you walk in.  And old fashioned candy store vibe includes pastel walls with Merry-Go-Round horses painted on one wall and stuffed animals on display on one end of the store, and tables full of novelty candies and the piece de resistance chocolates on display behind glass so clean it almost looks invisible.

PARKING:  Private lot.

ACCESSIBILITY:  Level in the door and all on one level inside with ample floor space.  ADA parking, including van accessible spot, right outside door.

THEY SHIP:  Their web site indicates they ship.  My recommendation would be to call the store to order or better yet go in to select an assortment if you're planning to send these along to someone special while the weather is still cool enough to ship chocolates.",30,3CwMwbY9UgP-qvTDxNs_0g

The service has been good and the gentleman at the counter was always kind and professional.  This week I had a very different experience.  A man I don't recall seeing before came out and harassed me after I inquired about the weekend specials.  Unprovoked, he began venting about politics in an extremely rude manner.  To avoid conflict, I quietly mentioned that my political affiliation was different from his.  Rather than backing off, the man began harassing  me about my political affiliation.  The other gentleman seemed to be trying to deflect by focusing on the deli meat, but he did not ask him to stop.  When the man was done yelling at me, he turned to the other gentleman and said, ""I don't want to wait on her, she's crazy.  You ring her up"".  To be clear, I am a sharp 70 year old woman and was not trying to engage in political debate at my local deli.  I barely said anything because I was so taken aback by the entire encounter.  I also can't help but wonder if t he encounter would have been different if I was a vibrant gen X male instead of a senior female.  Since this kind of harassment is inappropriate, unacceptable and downright harmful, I will not be patronizing this business anymore.  I would advise anyone who does not want to be berated for their political views to avoid this place.  It's a shame to say this, since this is a time when we should be supporting local businesses, but I cannot risk  being harassed again and I wouldn't want anyone else to have to endure this unpleasant experience either.",2,FCdDZV_OVwCjOgfUEjV_2A

So yes last year I did have a flight get cancelled on me.  However the communication was very clear well before I even left my house for the airport and they offered me reimbursement to fly out through another airline or a $500 voucher for each passenger.  Um, I took the vouchers and got in the car and drove to my destination.  The return flight of that reservation went fine and next two flights I took using the vouchers were flawless.  I just returned from a round trip with them and the flight down was delayed and again, that didn't bother me because I was home and knew the story and showed up in time to board essentially and it was only an hour or so late.  Nothing to worry about.  And the flight home was not only on time, it was early.  And we got home earlier than planned.  The staff on the airline is very nice.  Its easy to get through on the phone and they've helped me many times with changing things I needed to.  The last flight I took was rescheduled a day and I was notified of the change well in advance and they gave me $100 voucher per passenger for the inconvenience.  Another thing I liked was that we were traveling with my grandmother who walks with a cane and is hard of hearing.  The flight attendant had cards written up to easily communicate with her so he wouldn't have to shout at her.  They were also proactive with getting us a wheelchair when we arrived.  The planes are comfortable enough for what it is.  They do charge you for extras but so what?  You don't have to pay them.

My friend and I had come to Philly to try this restaurant as it was voted number one in the country and we were curious.

Service was impeccable. I couldn't tell you if service was better or the food and trust me the food was beyond great too. 


Food
To be honest, it baffles me a bit the price of this food for what you get because it just feels very affordable for the quality.

Pros: Customer Service was great. Perfect location for walking to restaurants and shops. Check out at 12:00, can extend to 1:00. Shower and separate bathtub. Bathtub is comfy and long(I'm tall so it was great) 

Cons: Walls are thin or the housekeeper is nosey. Idk but hotel staff came knocking on my door not even 2 minutes after I put Mystikal on . 
Not a good location if you plan on driving in and out. Once we parked, I didn't move it until check-out. Lots of congestion and took valet too long to bring my car around.

Problem one: they have a menu that lists ALL of their tamales but the only have a select few at a time. I was there with my partner who is a
vegetarian, for which they had ZERO options (in the way of tamales). They do offer veggie tacos though. But wait, the name of the business is The Tamale Place. Kiddin' me???

Problem two: the lady behind the counter was one of the rudest people I've ever encountered at a restaurant. She was impatient, to say the least. When I asked questions about options, she was unhelpful and reluctant to answer my questions. I was willing to look past this, only because my fellow Yelpers rave about how delicious the food is. Too bad I never even got to taste it, since after the following exchange she was apparently frustrated with me and walked away as I was mid sentence. 

What really sent me over the edge was this: I had ordered a chicken with green sauce tamale, a steak taco, and then asked if they had ground beef tacos. The  reply I got was ""they don't have ground beef tamales in Mexico, so we don't have them here."" REALLY???? A. I've never been to Mexico, so how the heck do I know what they do and don't have there? B. No where on your bunk menu does it state that all of your food is authentic. And C. why the heck would you have beef tacos? You don't even have all of the tamales on your menu.

I love devil crab and I got the jumbo one with a Carmine's side salad. A devil crab is like a round crab cake that only has breading on the outside. The inside should be all crab filling. Carmine's version is exactly what I expect to get when I order one, and you should eat it with hot sauce too. My salad was also very good.

I have eaten at the bar during lunch before when I came in by myself so would not have to wait for a table. There is also an outside patio area, but in all my years in Tampa, I have never been out there for any event.

I do not know how their service is at night (like before concerts or during parades or other events) but I can attest that I've had good service at lunch time.",0,x-aHM9y-vc5l2-XK4G6z1A

Personally, I find tattoo artists very intimidating because I've never had a good experience with one. Every single one I've met, with the exception of Pete, has been very arrogant, they didn't even want to bother talking to me unless we were on the topic of money. Stay away from those. On the other hand, Pete was super nice and accommodating throughout the whole 8 hour process. Called me up before my session to talk about my ideas and took his time (free of charge) putting the ideas together in a tangible image for me.

I was already confident in his ability to create a beautiful piece for me but seeing Pete be very enthusiastic throughout the whole process made me feel comfortable sharing my ideas. 

PRICE: Some people might be scared by what he charges but he's charging for years of tattooing experience, state of the art tattoo equipment (he has this neat tattoo machine that is supposed to tear the skin less AND it's super quiet compared to most noisy machines) AND he has other cool stuff that makes being tattooed for so many hours a much more pleasant experience.

I like IND, no question.  It's easily marked on the interstates, so getting there and navigating around is pretty easy.  The rental car facility is attached, and under cover, so very convenient.

I particularly like the light-and-sound artwork (for lack of a better term) on the pedestrian bridge to the main terminal.  It is eye-catching and fun, and perhaps a bit poignant at the same time.

The ticketing area is huge, with a VERY high ceiling.  It almost feels like being outside.  It at least provides a very comfortable and open atmosphere, something I really like.  Low ceilings are a huge turn-off for me.

I do have a couple of complaints in the next two areas, though... first being the TSA part.  Now, I'm not about to tell you that the TSA, its employees, or the system is at all flawed, poorly executed, or meaningless.  I know they have a very hard job to do, and it's difficult to be perfect at anything, with any real consistency.  To state bluntly, the crew here is more than capable and pleasant, and I have no qualms with this TSA location at all.

What I DO have an issue with is, why is there only one TSA Pre-Check gate?  That makes no sense.  I just got my authorization, so I'm not used to it maybe, but I don't see why I should go through the A gate for a flight on the B side.  Fortunately, it's a short walk between the two, but still... makes zero sense.

My second beef is with the location of the food court.  It's OUTSIDE security.  What sense does that make?  Maybe if you knew your flight was delayed, but otherwise, who is arriving and not getting through security first, before setting down to a drink or snack?  I just don't get it.  There are plenty of shops inside security, so why split them almost 50/50 towards the front side of the house?  It doesn't make sense.

Speaking of those options, there are plenty.  You shouldn't have a problem finding a decent bite to eat, or drink to enjoy, or last minute shopping item to grab.  There is plenty of space between gates, so you have a lot of room to stretch out and relax.  It really has a wonderful open feel to it.

I like IND a lot, I really do.  I would fly out of here over my home airport, I think.  There is artwork around to be enjoyed, there are vintage racing cars in the terminal, and the atmosphere is overall very relaxing.  Nicely done!",1,OYqbkGuG-FksdFhggwljjw

Before that, it was crazy trying to get anywhere in this store and the process just left you frustrated. Although that was years ago, the memory of it still lives on and I still associate Trader Joe's with a place that is just not worth it and I tend to stay far, far away from it.

However, I got their most recent ad in the mail and there were several items that sounded tasty so I convinced myself to give it another try. We came in on a Saturday and it was still pretty busy, but the extra room does help a little bit. 

I found one of the items right off the bat, a rarity when I'm in an unfamiliar store. I had to ask about another item in the frozen section, but the clerk knew exactly where it was. I wandered through the refrigerated section and the produce trying to find my last item and was unsuccessful. Then I realized there is another refrigerated section on the other side of store. So I stood there and stared not seeing what I needed, so I finally resorted to asking again. This clerk knew exactly where that item was too.

We headed to the check out lines, all of which were relatively short. But because it's me I got stuck behind the person who needed to split their items into four transactions. After two, I moved to a completely open line and was out of there.

Overall, a better experience than I've had in the past. I don't know if I'm up to task yet of just wandering the store to discover new products. For now, I'll just rely on their ads and those websites that are dedicated to chronicling what's good at Trader Joe's. However, it might become my ""I forgot something I need for dinner"" store since it's sort of on the way home and the store I used for that just closed so I'm in the market for a new one.",3,N11AGsSHMp9ZhOARSq8LNQ

First I must say the coffee here is HORRIBLE.  Some of the worst coffee I've ever had.  Some people would consider me a ""coffee snob"" as I am an ex-barista and generally tend to avoid the big chains (s-bucks and pjs), but I would much prefer to go to either of those places than get my coffee here.   My cappuccino tasted like dirt even with sugar added, and the drip coffee, while better than the espresso, is still just barely passable with milk and sugar, even though I normally drink my coffee black.  The real kicker here is that the coffee is actually more expensive here than at the finer coffee establishments in this city (velvet espresso, district donuts etc).  In fact, most things here seem over priced...
     The food is better than the coffee, but not exceptional.  The cookies are in a refrigerated display case, which I thought was odd (who wants a cold cookie?).  The blueberry muffin I had was pretty good, but unexceptional.  The chicken salad sandwiches in the cooler looked old, and I found the idea of a bagel and lox sandwich sitting in there quite gross.  (And at 12.50 I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't sell any of them).  Overall, I was very disappointed in my experience.  It seems like it would be a good place to sit and study for a while during the day, or just go to grab a quick bite before or after my morning classes, but I would rather go somewhere with at least decent coffee.  If I were to find out they upgraded the quality of their coffee, I would probably be here frequently, but until then I probably won't be back.",0,z_obsaCf7hlgU9KIf_SoMw

My partner is crime absolutely loves this and makes crazy flavors to put in his cone. I'm more of a plain Jane and stick with vanilla or chocolate ice cream with sprinkles (or jimmies, as you fine Philadelphians call them). 

So their flavor and topping selection is great but yet the place always seems to be empty. I blame this on their location at the bottom of an office building.

    They sent one tech out who told me a few screws needed to be replaced, but that he didn't have the right size...needed to order them....ok fine. Then that tech disappears, never to show up or answer a phone again.  After multiple calls (many that were unanswered, voicemails ignored)   to the company's dispatcher/owner? who knows.... another tech was sent out to again evaluate the problem (now 5 days after job ticket originated) this tech told my tenants that he would need more parts to fix the problem, left the house again without the dryer fixed.  On the 6th day I (the homeowner) get a call from a tech who tells me the ""everything is all messed up in there"" it now apparently was not just a matter of replacing screws.... the entire drum needed to be replaced at a cost of $780.00.  All of this after I was told just 2 days before that it was just replacement of screws that was needed.  Needless to say, I immediately called a different repair service company, had them go out to evaluate what was really wrong with the dryer. 
     The service man from this company inspected the unit and told me that the fix my appliance tech. who serviced the unit 6 months ago must have put in the wrong parts, rigged them to make them fit, or even cut the screw holes bigger to make the parts fit, also noted that a bearing/trunion that was replaced was done so with the wrong sized part....and that is why the screws now keep getting stripped and have caused irreparable damage to the dryer drum..... that's why it's now a $700.00 fix or more likely a $1600.00 replacement as the dryer is part of a stackable all in one unit.

The food was just as great as the service.  I consider myself a NY pizza snob, and this pizza was on par or better than most I have had in the city.  Quality toppings and great crust.  I will definitely come back.",1,jSQMekdAd663NuKqeif2Eg

First off, we love the interior of this place. We love the wood decor and Edison bulbs that light this place up. It was designed very well and it is just fun to be in this place. 

Second, the drinks. I haven't really been super impressed by the draft list, but the cocktail list makes up for it. Their mimosas and sangria's are legit. They are tasty and not overly strong. I've had the purple rain and enjoyed it. Their beer list is a good list but the beers they have, for me, I have to be in a certain mood to drink (I'm really not trying to sound like a beer snob when I say this).

Third, the food. I've had the pulled pork eggs benedict and the biscuits and gravy. Sooooo good. So much so that that is all I have to say about that. The quality of the food is made with heart and the chefs are driven by their craft.

Fourth, the service. Both times I have been here, the service has been great. When I go out to eat, being a server myself, I like it when my server is there but not pushy and isn't always in your face. Sometimes I know I can be that way but I haven't had that experience here. The servers are knowledgeable and make suggestions but they aren't in your face and they compliment your choices. That's big. That's good service!

He always says his cocktails are made with a special ingredient (love!) and I'm certain he's right. They are consistently on-point. And then, there's Sophie!

After finding out that Pampa's wouldn't honour their EDDW lunch special, my sister's friend switched our reservation over to Canteen. No idea why Pampa's would do that but they lost out on a massive group of 12 hungry eaters. Even though our reso was at 1:30pm, Canteen was packed with people. People just adore Sunday afternoon brunches.

Our waiter was decent given the size of our party. For the most part. Couple odd things I witnessed was:
a) he brought out couple coffees/Americanos/teas but had to literally shout out whatever drink it was as he couldn't remember who ordered what
b) he asked a couple people how their dishes was - when the first guy complained and pretty much critiqued everything on his plate, the waiter just nodded his head, said ""oh okay"" and proceeded to move to the next person and ask how their dish was. Ummmm, what?

The brunch menu is short and sweet with seven options to choose from. Honestly, nothing really stood out to me as oh my god I want to eat this but everyone else seemed excited.

- Dutch baby pancake ($17.00) - rhubarb compote, toasted coconut, walnut, back bacon and farm egg. S, my long forgotten lunch buddy, was here and she was nice enough to give me a bite. Interesting take on a ""pancake"", it looked like a fancy artisan green onion cake to some of us. Definitely didn't taste like one. It was actually quite good

- Chicken and waffle ($18.00) - buttermilk fried chicken, belgian waffle and smoked syrup. Guess this dish is popular if half (that's six out of twelve for those of you that suck at math) your table orders it. Yeezus. Seemed like a small portion to me. The one guy I was referring to above complained that his chicken and waffle dish was pretty average. Chicken not crispy enough, inside not tender and moist enough. Also odd was that each portion looked different from the other - three came out at once and one was clearly bigger than the other two.

- Huevos canteenos ($17.00) - corn tortilla, pulled pork, black beans, avocado, poached eggs, herb ricotta and pico de gallo. I ordered this dish for myself. I liked the avocado and the poached eggs were actually soft and yolky. I didn't get much pico de gallo nor black beans. Seemed like there was a bit too much pulled pork. The dish was tasty but the flavours were just missing some panache.

Canteen was pretty much what I was expecting. Good if you're looking for a more hip, chic spot but don't expect to be blown away.",0,xC-q_yh0XwcjRLimkS3RNg

I will say that they've cleaned up and completely re-branded the restaurant, but unfortunately, the good food and service was not there to stay. I went with a friend when it wasn't busy at all. There was one other customer sitting at the bar, and I gave it the benefit of the doubt because it was Thursday at 3pm on Magazine, so the absence of people weren't all that surprising, right? 

It took about 10-15mins for us to even be seated. There was not one server in sight, and there was a kitchen staff sitting in the corner, eating lunch. Suffice to say, it was awkward and unpleasant just standing there, staring at a sign that said ""wait to be seated."" So, we waited. And waited. The only thing that kept me going was the thought of how great the short rib bibimbap was gonna taste.

When we finally got seated, we commended the new digs and the new look of the menu, but honestly, it was still overpriced and if anything, they might have increased their prices. The banchan was good, tasted like it did in the old location. It wasn't anything special, but it kept the hunger at bay. 

When the food came, I was excited! There was no way they could mess up the Korean short ribs! Wrong! I don't know what happened, but they used a different kind of meat than before, and it was sliced way thinner, too. I was so terribly disappointed. And to add insult to injury, service was terrible as well. We had to ask for more water, and as someone who has worked as a server, that is a giant mistake, especially when you have no other tables and the restaurant is empty. We waited forever for the check, and then we waited forever for the server to come pick up our payment. I had to walk to the server area to hand it to him. What was he doing? Just sitting down and chatting.

First and foremost, the service is incredible. You feel like a high roller from the phone order to the tablecloth room service. No complaints there at all.

I would say that the food needs a little more than a lot of help.

I ordered the filet mignon with steamed vegetables and mashed potatoes. I added a house salad just because I wanted to pretend I was being healthy. To drink I cheated out and got a Voss water. Total bill was $61.05

The filet was ordered med rare and that's how it came. But the beef wasn't seasoned and the texture of the meat was grainy which was depressing. Filet should melt and have a soft chew, instead it was a spongy beef and due to the lack of salt, my brain couldn't register the flavor of beef (and I don't smoke) which made me panic for a small moment on the first bite. As if they knew this would happen, they left me with a bottle of A1.

Suggestion: sous vide the filet in olive oil with herbs and some salt (for the love of culinary holiness! Add salt!!!). Then sear to order.

Mashed potatoes were simple tray potatoes simply plated and cratered with a ladle of brown gravy. Taste similar to KFC. 

The steamed vegetables were fine. Gray, but fine.

The salad, which I was told was a full size salad, seemed lightweight for charging $6 at regular price. The cucumbers were old, rubbery, and discolored, some of the greens were wilted and browning towards the bottom of the salad. Croutons are from a bag.

The best items on the room service menu is anything you could get from a diner; burgers, fried anything, soup, and the rolls.

- Supergreen Thai coconut curry sounded amazing on the menu: Wok-seared carrots, green beans, Swiss chard, onions, garlic, ginger and lemongrass, tossed with Thai coconut green curry sauce and garnished with Thai basil, scallions, cilantro and a lime wedge BUT it was bland. The chicken tasted like it was boiled and added into the dish, it had a slimy coating which was very inedible.

I thought I'd give it a try again for the ""All You Can Eat Crabs"" they've been advertising around the area.   They have solved the service issues, at least.  

The AYEC experience was a bit pricey, at $30 a head, and you're seated in a separate section of the restaurant than the normal dining room.  You're given the choice of garlic crabs or old bay, and they bring out fries and cole slaw.  The fries were the highlight of the night, they were great, fresh, shoestring fries, done crisply with good seasoning.  The cole slaw also appeared to be fresh, but had a horseradish flavor that was off-putting to me.  Some might like it, but I didn't care for it.   

The star of the show ought to have been the crabs, obviously.  They're #1 blue points, which are the tiny ones.  Barely enough meat to bother picking.  We first ordered garlic, and the first two heaping buckets came out, the crabs covered in gray-brown glop reeking of rancid oil, and having no discernible garlic favor.    They were completely inedible.  

The replacement old bay were passable, but extremely salty.  The crabs came out steamed and clean, with lots of old bay seasoning inside the body cavities -- leading me to think they had been pre-cooked and then heated and seasoned.  They were not bad, but again, small crabs, too much salt, and not enough meat.

I took the advice of Zach X. and tried the Shredded Pork w/ Garlic Sauce ($9).  It was pretty damn good, with flavors that reminded me of hot and sour soup.  It was a bit too saturated in sauce, however.  Great portion and plenty to take home.

Now the not-so-good.  We wanted a vegetable dish so we went for the ""Chinese Vegetable Surprise"" or something like that ($8).  It was a gamble that did not pay off.  It was basically a ton of bok choy leaves with pieces of tomato and eggplant, drowned in some sort of brown sauce.  Unfortunately the sauce was kind of slimy.  I couldn't imagine actually eating a piece of the slimy bok choy.  I did pick off some of the pieces of eggplant which were also slimy, but pretty tasty.

I was given a short form to complete, concerning my services, and offered a mimosa while I received star quality treatment at the salon. The decor is gorgeous, and the mimosa was delicious. I didn't have to wait forever to be serviced, like I have in countless other salons. They were very timely, and even give an estimated time of completion on the work.

My hair: LOVED IT!!!! There's a style book to chose from, or suggest your own. I have been a few times, and am pleased with the work every time. De' Adrian is AWESOME!!!

I went with my own hair a few times, but I won't do that again, because as soon as I tried their Brazilian hair, I fell in love. I wore it for months, and re-used it. Very High quality hair, that had not shedded, nor tangled. This place is grade A, there's no question about that.

It's a place with both a great local beer selection and a fantastic assortment of teas. The three owners, Craig Martellica, Levi Christensen, and Christoph Janke, always seem to be working, and they'll gladly pour you a pint and tell you which band is going to play next.

Wunderbar is a neighbourhood bar where people dance like a mix of junior high awkwardness and characters in a Charlie Brown Christmas special. The patio is one of the finest in the city, looking out onto East Whyte Avenue. The sticky patio tables share many memories, and it seems like sharpies should be included for those sitting outside.

The bathrooms - fair warning - are pretty frightening. The walls are covered with sharpied notes from management, and other folks. Meanwhile, the sink and paper towel dispenser are both a bit grungy.

Despite that, the atmosphere in Wunderbar is second to none. The people who go to Wunderbar are friendly, which is a nice change from the normal bar scene.  If you're looking for a bar to chill out at, or enjoy some local tunes, Wunderbar is your place!

But just FYI: bring cash. The ATM frequently doesn't work.

Also - there are occasionally paninis, but it's best to eat first. This isn't a place that serves food.

It's important to note that although Wunderbar has been around for a while, this old place is new again. It's been under new ownership since 2010.",6,vi0t612Xq4x5HDbZU_HfHQ

I hope someone from this place can remedy this situation especially since we paid full price for three sandwiches that were incomplete.

Our party ordered a variety of entrees and none were impressive. 
-Carne Asada was fine, but very stingy serving for the price. 
-Mole pablano chicken was quite unappetizing - dry and bitter. 
-Quesadillas were average. You can't mess up meat & cheese between tortillas too badly.
-Rice and beans were total snoozeville.
All in all: BO-RING.

On top of it all, they place a thick white piece of paper over the table. It hangs just to the edge of the table, thus giving me several papercuts all over my hands curing the mediocre dinner. EPIC FAIL.

Survey... pls respond with your thoughts.  I'm here with my grand daughter visiting from Vegas.  She asks for dippin dots.  So we get her a large.  The cup is a bit unbalanced, top heavy and when she puts it on the table it spills all over the table.  She's a bit upset, so I clean up the table and push all the dirty dots back into the cup.  I go back to the stand and ask if they would give us a new one.  Nope, you got to buy another one.

I see the lead at the front gate and she starts giving me excuses about they can't tell if she already ate part of it.

Well, they got me this time, I paid twice for the same snack.

Should they have replaced the cup of dippin dots?

If you're a business owner or customer, what do you think?

Had a terrific table with a water view (OK, it was night, but we could still enjoy the lights on Tampa Bay). Service was terrific, very professional and attentive. But most importantly, the food was divine.  Blackened grouper, lobster mac and cheese, fresh oysters....even the dessert was superb.  We ordered a bottle of chardonnay that is exclusive to the Hyatt chain (nicely priced and quite delectable).

Saturday nights there's a piano player (actually quite good), which added to the charm and ambience.

Normally, I would have ventured farther from our hotel, the Sailport Waterfront Suites, and I usually avoid any hotel restaurant on principle.  But we were so impressed with Oystercatchers, we agreed it was the only place we wanted to eat at for a second time, so back we went the next night -- and had another fabulous meal!

Service: We walked in and our food was ready as promised, 15 minutes after I placed the order.  We were in and out in 2 minutes.  

Food: We started with the gyoza which were well cooked, but lacked any real flavor or spice.  Since we were at home, I added some garlic sriracha and they were great.  I don't know what options (if any) they have in house to spice things up. 

The black garlic was good, but not great.  I LOVE garlic, so I was content with the super earthy garlic flavor, but it did overpower whatever other layers of flavor were there.  The spicy pork (Jigoku) was flavorful but not spicy.  Actually we only finished 1/2 or so of each ramen and ate them the next day.  The Jigoku was better, but the garlic was simply more garlic-intense.  I also felt like there was a very small serving of protein in each of the bowls.  I know, ramen is about the noodles but I think the dishes would have benefitted from more variety of flavor and texture. 

The to-go set up was okay.  The ""stuff"" is in the bowl and the broth comes in a container to pour over. The bowl really isn't big enough or stable enough to eat out of but it looks pretty.  Also, I assumed that the noodles were only par-cooked because it was takeout but they did take a while to soften and soak up the broth enough to eat them.

Especially in the CBD. Now they have one in Elmwood which is pretty cool for the area as there aren't any other frozen yogurt places in the immediate vicinity. 

They have a fairly decent selection of yogurt flavors but I just found that some, with the exception of the chocolate flavors, are bit too tart for my tastes. They also have a pretty good selection of toppings and fruits. 

The place is in a prime location but I guess I'm more of a Pure Yogurt fan rather than a Pinkberry fan. Call me nuts but I like to add as many toppings as I want when I create my yogurt concoction. Pinkberry is nice but I've had better.",3,FA0svNuBlW-lDh5f0vRK6g

My friend and I dined here recently and I really liked it. It was my first time and the interior is very sleek. We settled at the bar (I think the most romantic option when the place is empty, personally) and ordered away: charcuterie plate, grilled lamb lollipops, lobster mac n cheese, cheese empanadas. The charcuterie plate contained a delicious assortment of sliced meats, sausages and pickled vegetables. Meat and pickled things...I was in heaven already. I did think the lobster mac and cheese was a little bit overdone/dry but it was still tasty. the cheese empanadas were flavorful and really good. But my personal favorite was the grilled lamb lollipops...delish. Spicy, charred meat on a stick...what more can you ask for!

It is on a nondescript plaza and is adjacent to Petra Middle Eastern Cuisine pm Busch Blvd.. Upon entering, you can see an vibrant yellow/red/green cafe with flags of various Caribbean countries.

Note: There is a five dollar minimum  to use credit card. 
There is one lady  who handles dine in and take out orders. She was very friendly. I had to wait 12 minutes but when she brought out the food. I was in awe.

There were 4 pieces of chicken, rice and ""peas"" (red rice and beans for us Yankees) and cabbage. This amount of meat in a $9 combo meal dwarfs food Ive had in Level 2 chain restaurants and makes Chipotle/Moe's look microscopic in comparison. While I've had Caribbean food at Jerk Hut on Fowler and Jerk Pit on Fletcher, CC blows them away. The chicken was so soft and had awesome level of spice. (For folks who are scared, there is a normal or spicy option that she asks before taking the order) 

The rice and beans was so awesome that I ate it fully before the meat. 
Whoever owns a Mexican restaurant should study how these guys make it since most ESE restaurants are mediocre here and seem to coast by on rice and beans.
Im generally not a big cabbage fan, but they prepared it so well here. 
While I was eating, I noticed many customers coming and getting takeout so they seem to have a thriving business.
I really loved the food, and thought I should take something home since Friday nights I dont like to cook anything. I ordered a chicken curry roti to take home .
Later in the evening after doing groceries and swimming, I got to the roti , thinking it would be a small wrap or burrito. It was a giant square shaped dish with chicken and potato pieces wrapped with a roti. Im not joking when I said this one thing would be enough for Juggernaut, or Mark Henry (400 lb wrestler). I could only eat half and saved the rest for tonight.
They also serve beef patties, plaintains, doubles and some veg curries in addition to homemade Caribbean drinks like Ginger beer, sorrel. They also have canned sodas incuding Jupina here.  Yay!

Cons:
They close early 7 or 8 pm. Sunday is fully closed.
There is a $1 dollar surcharge to make boneless curry roti.

I love their fast service and Amoroso's bread. My only complaint is that they should season the steak a little more.

--- Detailed Review ---

Having only paid for 30 minutes of street parking, I was worried if I would be able to get some Jim's with the line out of the door and around the corner. Luckily, with their quick service, I was able to get my cheesesteak in time! Hooray for quick service!

My favorite part of the cheesesteak was the Amoroso's bread. The soft texture and taste are just amazing together. It is also easier to eat as the rolls are small enough to fit into your mouth.

The onions were a little too well done and greasy for me, as I could not really taste any onion flavor; however, I noticed they did have less cooked onions and would ask for those next time.

I enjoyed the meat not being overly greasy, but I wish it did have more seasoning (salt). This was easy to fix as I could add my own seasoning upstairs in the seating area.",2,stUwmVSvwF0sb-NE7IRM-w

The only knock I would have on them would be that they do not offer takeout. Seems like a missed opportunity to me because my colleagues and I would definitely take advantage as opposed to going other places for quick lunch. 

There is nothing amazing here. Just always consistent and never wavering and it works for them. I cannot recall a bad experience here. It doesn't matter if it is 2 pm on a Tuesday or the Friday night dinner rush, they are always busy. Winning formula.

So it's a typical winter Sunday in Edmonton, my girlfriend and I decided to try something new.

Asked a table for two, at 5 pm with a pretty much half full restaurant you'd think this wouldn't be a problem...

Apparently not.  The host said that it would be an hour wait, they were waiting for some reservations that didn't show up yet and that ""they like to have 2 hour seatings so that their guests have time to sit back and relax"".

As others have said, (and I should have paid attention), I have had better Cuban/Spanish food, especially in Tampa. The first thing that comes to mind is BLAND.  That is very odd for Spanish food, but little to no flavor on the yellow rice. Soup was ok, but some of the chicken in it truly appeared not cooked. Could have been just the appearance, but it really did look like it had not been cooked well.
All and all the specials are over 7.00 and truly not worth it, at least to me. Granted obviously the yellow rice and chicken is not, I don't know about others entrees. Others may have a different experience. It truly is bland, however, so if you like bland and little to no flavor and or seasoning, you might like it. I am assuming if the yellow rice and chicken is bland so is everything else.
I don't order Spanish food for bland. Truly the VIGO rice you make at home from a packet has much better flavor and that should not be the case.

The place seemed fine enough at first. I made myself a cup of peanut butter frozen yogurt, topped with PB sauce and Reese's cups. Price was OK (mine cost around $4). I brought my sundae back to my office, and...

...it was probably the worst ice cream/frozen yogurt I've ever had, anywhere, or ever. The fro-yo tasted very tart-like, and from the first bite I hated it, and regretted the purchase. Horus later, I am still fuming that I wasted $4, and 500+ calories, on this monstrosity. 

Bottom line: Don't EVER go here. Especially with Scoop DeVille, a FANTASTIC ice cream place, just a few doors down. Or Bassett's Ice Cream in the Terminal Market or throughout the city.

Usually, she's super hard to get an appt with (I'm talking months) but my initial appt was only a few weeks from the time I called to set it up. She took her time getting to know me and my concerns, answered every question I had gently, but honestly, and made sure I understood everything before I walked out of the office. 

The wait time kind of sucks so I suggest anyone going for an appt bring something to keep you occupied. I've been in to see her 3 times since August (setting up follow-up appts are a breeze with her great staff there, btw) and every time had left me waiting about an hour. Kind of stinks but honestly, she's such a good dr that it's worth the wait. 

Kudos to the staff, also. They go above and beyond to make sure my calls are returned and non-medical questions are answered. Especially Pat, who was kind enough to take care of an issue this week for me.

Well, cause my Converse's are a little big for my feet, that's why. The skates were nasty looking and feeling, the second sock was a lifesaver. 

The music was good. The floor was nice and shiny with a few ridges awaiting the new skaters, and there were games for non-skaters or tired skaters to partake.

I found John Donuts Co because I was going to be in St Louis for work one week and needed to pick up about 13-15 dozen donuts for some meeting I had. Now maybe there is something I don't know about but in MO, Dunkin Doughnuts  are not on every corner like here in Chicago lol. In fact I when looking a week prior to what will be in the area for Donuts I didn't find much of anything. But luckily I did find this place! 

The reviews cracked me up so I was like what the hell! Why not?
So I called ahead for 13 dozens and set off on my tip. When I got there to pick up my donuts I was at first worried I was heading into the wrong area. Its very industrial and by a tattoo place.. but don't be alarm you are there! 

The donuts are about $6-7 a dozen (can't remember exactly cause I ordered so much) and they rang me up and offered me free coffee to go with the purchase. Which I thought was sweet cause in Chicago, I've made these big orders and never get offered anything free! But even better they guys helped me bring the stuff out to the car. I know it sounds dumb to even mention this.. but I have ordered for MANY of MANY places for these meetings and its rare these days for people to want to help you cause they just don't care. 

Here at John's they are so friendly, and give you a good laugh in the morning. And let me tell you, I also ordered bagels from another retailer and at the meeting the people were going crazy about the donuts asking me where I got them and I was happy to say its only 15 mins away! In fact they were such a hit. I decided to pick up about 8 more dozen for small meetings I had the next day. Once again I stop in and they staff was great and even made me take some free donuts for my self and helped me to my car. 

They have this apple crisp donut... and OMG I want to drive all the way back out there just for that. Big chain places have NOTHING on these donuts! 

Helpful Tips:
-Don't be scared GPS is taking you down a strange road... its right! 
-Be prepared to have a laugh no matter how early, the staff is a riot.
-Be prepared to be addicted to them, cause they are sweet and so fresh! 
-At around closing time they offer dozens for cheaper just to get rid of them so you know they aren't serving you nasty donuts the next day!",8,aexlYahba6OUYCPDRXpiRA

good. Beef-chicken and goat two different rice dishes and just white rice. Naan bread. Two desserts one was like a rice pudding and the other was kind of fruity put the more you ate the more you wanted. Or you can order off the menu.

Ambience: 5
Service: 5
Food: 1
Magic: 3

So I took my wife to this restaurant for her birthday last Saturday night. We wanted to try something new and we liked the idea of getting dressed up for a night on the town so we went for it. We were initially greeted at an indistinct doorway by a smartly dressed doorperson and lead to a non-descript entrance way. This was fun and the personality of the doorperson was perfect. She was very nice but had a reserved air of mystery about her that well suited the place.

There is a sort of gothic, stonework kind of entrance/tunnel and then you get to the main, very speakeasy-like dining room/bar area. The ambiance was very appropriate to the theme. To some extent it was as I pictured in my mind but there were a few surprises as well. The ghost piano (who responds to voice song requests) and the outdoor courtyard with waterfall were both nice additions.

Our server greeted us right away and was very professional and expedient the entire night. He gave us the option of speeding through our courses to make the earlier magic show or dragging it out and going to the later one. We opted to go slow. This allowed us to get up and walk around between courses but he also always found us and patiently let us know when our next course had arrived to our table. He explained everything well and made some thoughtful suggestions.

The food itself was kind of average at best and downright awful at other times. We got the scallops as an appetizer. The were cooked very well but the presentation and pairing was pretty bland. For our entrees we ordered two filet mignons and added a side of the brussell sprouts. Per their policy, steaks ONLY come with mashed potatoes as a standard side and if you want anything green, that's an add-on. Like... really?  MASHED potatoes? You can't at least give me a baked potato or let me choose what I want to go with my $50 steak? The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare but my god, it was THE most salty piece of meat I've ever eaten. It honestly made me sad for a nice cut of filet to be salted like that. It was like opening your mouth while swimming in the dead sea. I was dehydrated and my blood pressure was elevated for two days after (not kidding). This seemed to be the theme because the brussell sprouts were the same way. Just so unbelievably salty. They were gross. The only thing that wasn't crazy salty (although still salty enough) was the mashed potatoes but those had this weird, thick, congealed kind of layer on the bottom of my portion. I could tell they scooped them out of a steam heated pan that they had been in for far too long. Not the correct texture at all. Didn't eat but 1 bite of those.

The magic. Okay, that's what we're there for, right? The magicians that were working the small tables in the dining room were fantastic. We saw three different guys, each with their own style and selection of tricks. Some were card tricks. Some were slight of hand. Some were total head scratchers for me. They were all great. Then there was the guy in the main ""Carter The Great"" auditorium. Oh man... that guy. It was not Carter. I don't know who Carter is but whoever we saw must have been his apprentice or something. This magic was (sigh...) not great. Really cheesy, prop driven tricks that you'd find at like a kid's birthday party. The rings going into each other. The pulling the long string of hankerchiefs out of the mouth. The keep pulling the foam ball out of the mouth (even though it is so obvious that you are not and it's the same ball over and over). It was the kind of ""magic"" that insults your intelligence and actually just ended up making me angry. Also the auditorium where this goes on was way over-packed with people and it was hot and uncomfortable. Cheesy and lame is what best describes that part of the evening.

Like others have said, I think it's a worthwhile place to check out but skip the entrees and skip the auditorium show (which you need to buy an entrée to see) and just go for drinks and to hang out for a while.

They gotta get that food on point though. Nashville has WAAAY too many rock solid places to eat in this price range to be slacking with bad food.",3,8ZJ5uK_p5Cui9cC64Lw0wA

As another reviewer mentions, it's an atrium hotel (like the Embassy Suites), only you don't get that hallway and atrium noise here.  Perhaps it's the lack of a water fountain or better insulation, but the noise level is much quieter.  Here's why I would never stay here again:

1. The hotel's airport shuttle took 20 minutes to arrive.  I saw the same Doubletree van pass me twice.
2. The hotel's airport shuttle was blowing hot air in 90-degree weather.  It was turned on to AC, but it was hot air.  For the entire 20-minute ride back to the hotel, so it wasn't that the van just needed to warm up in order to blow out cold air.  It was better to open the windows, only two windows worked.
3. There is no trashcan in the bathroom so you have to carry all your bathroom trash into the main room.
4. The concierge lounge really closes after hours so you cannot even go in to use the printer or grab a water.  Your key simply won't let you in.
5. While I was in the shower in the morning at 8:00 a.m., I felt a slight breeze and then heard what sounded like door noise (my bathroom door was open).  I then really heard the door open because it banged against the security lock/chain.  Whoever managed to open my door didn't say anything, just closed and left.  After my shower, I double-checked and the chain had definitely been disturbed.  And this was not a guest who was mistakenly given the wrong key because I had the lock and the chain on in my room.  This meas it was hotel staff who have the ability to bypass the locking mechanism, but thankfully, not the chain. This was at 8:00 a.m.  When I left my room at 8:30, I didn't see a maid cart around.  What I did see was a maintenance worker leaving another room with what looked like industrial bug spray.  He was just going through room-by-room.  Later, as I came down from the concierge lounge, I noticed that the elevator smelled like Raid.  The smell was even more intense when I rode the elevator again 10 minutes later to check out.  My business associate who was also staying at the hotel told me that he overheard the workers talking about shutting down the elevators so they could fumigate.  Dear hotel: if you have a bug problem, you really should just shut the hotel down and fumigate instead of letting your travelers take bugs back home with them.
6. As if all that is not enough, don't eat the food in the concierge lounge.  For breakfast, there is no meat option (no bacon, no sausage).  I got some pineapple and it was rotten.  Looked okay on the outside, but as soon as I ate it, it was rancid.  Then I went to get some raspberries.  One had white, fuzzy mold growing on it.  The others had the black rotten spots on them.",0,LUnMk7bZyqlxBL4QjU3iDw

Drinks good. Service great. Food yuck.

Now on to the nitty gritty details....

I came here with 2 friends for an impromptu ladies night dinner this weekend. It was packed in here, which one would think is a good sign. One of the people in our group started out with a french onion soup, which was tasty. That's where the tasty food ends, for the most part. However, the $2.50 margaritas they were offering for happy hour were decent, especially for the price, so I'll give them that. Our server was attentive and genuinely caring throughout the experience, but unfortunately those cooks back in the kitchen were trying to ruin it for us all. 

I had the flat iron steak with mashed potatoes and veggies. The other 2 people I was with had the lobster tails with veggies and salmon. The problems started when they asked for drawn butter for their seafood. What was brought out was not drawn butter, but rather some watery-chemical version of imitation butter. We asked the server where the ""real butter"" was, but were informed they only carry whipped margarine, which is then melted in the microwave. A place with multiple seafood dishes on the menu can't manage to carry real butter??!! Hmm....
Next issue.. my steak was actually quite tasty and cooked just as I asked it, so that's a plus, but the side items were sorely lacking. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was so SPICY and salty, it was inedible. I've never had spicy gravy in my life, not sure why they're trying to reinvent the wheel with that. The mixed veggies were not cooked enough and the carrots were still crunchy. Meh.

The only reason I'm not giving them a 2 star review, is because the manager did really seem to be concerned about our concerns. When the server asked how everything was and we politely expressed our disappointment, she brought the manager over right away. He apologized, offered to bring us something else and then ultimately comped part of the bill. We are not people who go to restaurants to complain and try to get a free meal, this was honestly an isolated incident for us, but I did appreciate his willingness to remedy the situation.

Honestly, I may consider coming back here for happy hour, but definitely not for food again.",4,2b2J7kW1nTVTtiZtizw-tw

The eateries focus is to stay locally sourced and sticking to the roots of the dish; bringing flavours straight from Hawaii. It was a huge tease as they started their Instagram page with posts to entice their opening, we saw a glimpse of the chef make his way down to the Island for a ""Poke trip"", literally taking inspiration from the source.

To the brick and mortar, spacious and welcoming. High ceilings with great big windows welcoming a whole lot of natural light in, lightly decorated with pots of flowers on each table/corner to remind you ~Hawaii. With plenty of tables and seating, this spot seems to be more of a welcoming place to hangout with your bowl. I liked the calm and mellow vibe.

The line starts at the back of the room, where you're essentially choosing your bowl. They have 6 feature bowls with specials that change weekly.

Uncle Tom's Sur Poke - R($14.95) - 5/5 - I'm completely in love with the flavors that came out of this. Ahi tuna with spicy tobiko aioli with a mix of fresh toppings on top of a bed of half furikake rice and half spring mix salad. Only realizing now that my bowl missed the wasabi crab chips.. So... that happened. But it's okay, the flavors were completely oozing umami. The ahi tuna marinated and seasoned amazingly with a bounce of flavor that stuck with every single cube of fish which paired in unison with the aioli, i'm addicted.

'Ono Poke - R($14.95) - 3/5 - Slightly disappointed with how lacking of flavor this bowl was. Ahi tuna paired with shoyu sauce, sesame oil, hawaiian salt, along with a mix of fresh toppings. With both shoyu and sesame oil listed you'd expect the taste to be savory at it's best. Both soy sauce and sesame oil being very distinctive flavors, I'm surprised at how bland this bowl was. But research before arriving concluded there was a mix of reviews on how some of the bowls were ""too"" salty, so maybe they tweaked it a little too far.

Prices are a little higher than what you'd get just a block away, but from my bowl alone, I liked the flavors of the fish and the accompaniment of the aioli a lot! I'll be back to Ono soon!",1,-9QrNxZ0l0cSbTYXPlsu_g

To the shower I go. Switch it on and water proceeds to shoot out from the sides of the shower head, spraying the floor, walls, toilet, mirror and me. On the plus side I can now skip the shower.

The entire hotel is dated, and not particularly clean. The elevators are smudged and streaked with the fingerprints of guests long since gone. The carpets look like someone has been murdered on them. I came back to my room after the first day to find my bathroom had been cleaned, towels refreshed, but my bed still unmade. Seriously Embassy Suites, WTF is going on here LOL?

Both the gym and the pool were out of commission during my stay there, although if they're anything like the rest of the hotel, I didn't miss much.

The only redeeming thing about this place (and the reason it gets 2 stars not 1) is the complimentary happy hour at the bar.  Get drunk enough and you might not care about the noise, lack of cleanliness and leaking shower heads.",1,QjJ750mAEJa8Nxcklb5GQg

When the driver arrived he offered a check for $1326 BELOW THE APPRAISAL. I called their office and Matthew #2 stated that I had given them the wrong mileage and that they had re-appraised it. We told them to go away. The fact is that I never gave them ANY mileage. Their rep got it from AT or CL, WHERE IT WAS CORRECT. NOT MY ERROR. They placed me on hold to speak to the supervisor (Stephanie). After 15 minutes the hold music ended. After 19 minutes the call disconnected.

Great portion sizes, too-cheap prices, the flavor is out of this world, and it's shockingly vegan-friendly for an authentic Chinese spot. This place is far too good to be true.

We got the salty dou hua, sweet dou hua with red bean, youtiao (long donut-like fried dough), obligatory hot soy milk, and the taro cake. 

If you have any appreciation at all for complex flavors and a little spice, get the salty dou hua. The funk and intensity instantly transported me from Philly straight back to Guangxi. Absolutely incredible. Skip the tiny shrimp if you're veg, and know that you're not missing out. 

Sweet dou hua was a solid choice as well, but lacked the magical powers of the salty version. I feel like I'm used to more ginger flavor?

The youtiao here was the best I've ever had, and that includes many Chinese street food adventures. So fresh, no hint of excess grease, with an absolutely perfect crisp and pillowy texture. Their soy milk is the perfect accompaniment. 

Taro cakes were okay but would have benefited fron some sweet/sour/spicy sauce, fantuan (rice roll) was acceptable but not super fresh and didn't have as much pickle as I usually like. Really looking forward to trying their chaomian noodles and other stuff next time. 

Don't wait, don't think ""I'll do it next week"" and then end up putting it off until next year like I did. Just order pretty much everything (again, very affordable) and treat yourself to the best.",4,m4hU1am0NHVBlGmcQJ1rMg

I truly enjoyed my experience here. We started out with the fried green tomatoes. They were so good. They were served on a bed of goat cheese grits and marinara sauce. I would have never thought that this combination together would be good, but it was. The tomatoes were fried to perfection. 

For my meal, I have the buffalo cauliflower. I heard of many people having these as replacements for hot wings. That was my goal until I decided I wanted some actually hot wings (yeah that lil healthy food went right out of the door)! The cauliflower wings were delicious. They had just the right amount of crisp and sauce. If I would've known that they give a generous helping I would have only gotten them. However, I don't regret getting the wings.

I love the complimentary homemade biscuits that they have waiting hot and fresh served with molasses and home made jam.

The place was decorated with lights and had a nice ambiance. Spanish Christmas music played over our heads some of which got redundant after a while and most had a Gregorian vibe to it. It made for good conversation. I met my family at the bar which looked like a bar I'd have a drink at, but we proceeded sit down to our table. The dining room was filled with about 10 tables some set up for large parties and one wall appeared to be ready for a buffet line sans food. Our table was a folding table which was unusual but not a problem. 


We ordered a couple bottles of wine and appetizers. The vegi empanadas were excellent. Perfectly cooked and not greasy. The contents of which were flavorful, not dry and didn't make you miss meat filled ones. The sauce was amazing. 

I was in the mood for a basic chicken and saffron rice and soup because it was cold that night.The potato leek was delicious but could have been hotter. The chicken and saffron rice was very good and comforting. I prefer bone in chicken and the meat was cooked perfectly. 

My mom had the Mariscada ""Málaga"" and it looked awesome, yes I was jealous and should have ordered that. My brother had vegi paella and it was good, I had some leftovers and had it the next night. 

The specials all sounded interesting. 


The wine selection although limited was a perfect listing of regional wines made from Tempranillo or Granacha which, after all,you can't go wrong with that. Also priced right.

Service was very attentive until the larger crowds came in for ""office parties"" which was understandable. The waiter was helpful and very careful to answer the many questions my brother had about the dishes. The service was very good. 

They gave us a free drink at the end of the meal which was appreciated and unexpected.

The owner came over and asked us how our meal was and wished us holiday greeting, then proceeded to get our coats from the coat check.

I don't travel frequently, but recently have been traveling to the Indy area for work.  I really wanted a steak tonight and went to Sullivan's based on reviews and wasn't disappointed. 

I sat at the bar tonight and was immediately impressed with the unobtrusive yet attentive bar staff.  They made great drink/food suggestions and didn't make me feel uncomfortable for just ordering a steak.  

Also noteworthy is that I'm a bit of a steak-snob.  I don't like any butter or sauce; salt and pepper is more than enough.  The staff was completely understanding and never made me feel like i was the outcast customer.  

In short, the food itself was fantastic.  I ended up ordering a wedge salad and the big filet, both were very well executed.  I HATE burned steaks, this was one of the best steaks I've had in a couple years.  

Overall, I don't write strong suggestions on eateries, but Sullivan's was worth writing about.",1,_haM_f1f7JIYqaqGLyqntQ

Bread: warm, seasoned, and great with olive oil and balsamic. A little dense but good.

Caesar Salad: Best item we tried. Light dressing, very fresh tasting, good cheese.

Chicken Parmigiana: Large portion of chicken. Good marinara sauce. Cooked well but lacked some flavor on the crust of the chicken. The main thing was there was not enough of the sauce and the pasta was really average. I would have rather just had the chicken and no pasta at all. 

GF Pizza: my mother is gluten free, so it was nice that they had the option for her. The crust was as good as Gluten free crust gets :) but the main issue was that the toppings were very sparse.

We were greeted by lovely friendly staff and a menu offering great variety of different flavours, including a fantastic Assam tea I can only assume came from next door.   Pics posted - I had the Saigon wrap and my bf had the Canadian panini.

Sadly we both thought our meals were average, although nicely presented. My overall impression is: nice concept, good ideas, not quite coming to fruition just yet.  Needs more of a flavour ""wow"" factor, a punch to really bring out some of the combinations in the sandwiches.  

Examples: the Saigon wrap was a bit dry (hard to balance between having enough sauce and it being too messy, especially to grill) and could have been more flavourful - I could barely taste the sweet chili lime sauce.  Similarly, although the Canadian was moister the flavour of maple mayo was so subtle as to be non-existent.

We were in town for a conference and wanted to go over to Hattie B's for some hot chicken because we heard that's the place to go. Unfortunately it was hot, we were sweating, and didn't feel like waiting for the hour to get in for some hot chicken, so we walked across the street to this place. 

I saw the reviews on Yelp and heard their wings were amazing (confirmed!)

It is a very low-key place, borderline dive, which is not necessarily a bad thing.

They do allow smoking, so we were not thrilled with that, but we were there so we figured we would make the best of it. The waiter was friendly and got us our pints quickly. The beer was nice and cold.

Since we heard the wings were good we figured we would try those. They were absolutely amazing!

My son recently saw the phenomenal film; See You, Yesterday and has been inspired to rewatch Back to the Future. Unfortunately Target didn't have it but that's not my issue with this store, I'm definitely not that petty. 

I decided to get two random things I did need so I didn't have to make an extra stop on the way home. I grabbed some Windex and dental floss. As I got to the registers I noticed the only two lanes that had an employee at them also had a long enough line that made me go to the self-check out. Also not my issue since I wouldn't take the time to leave a review just for that. 

My issue begins and ends within the 5 minutes it took to to ring myself up. When Robin, who I guess didn't have a register to be working at the time, decided to come stand 4 feet from where I was ringing myself up. Staring at me as I did so. The camera screen wasn't working at the self checkout so I could see her clear reflection right behind me. She didn't do this for any body else though.

I don't know if I just seemed different towards her, out of the ordinary maybe from her perspective she's lived her life in. 
I don't know if it's because I'm a 6'2"" tall black male with dreadlocks and paint on his paints or if I was just ""randomly selected"" to be monitored as I paid for my items but I felt so disrespected and reminded.

Clyde and/or 'management',

Are you seriously being condescending to me for placing my child in her pack and play while I grab the rest of my bags RIGHT OUTSIDE OF THE DOOR? Gross. Claiming something as 'state of the art' doesn't in fact make it such (In fact its quite laughable when you visit the property.) I also find it 'amusing' that when my husband ran down to the front desk they told him that the doors on the property are known to have issues-yet you seem clueless  Your lack of ownership is appalling. Your lack of knowledge about your water supply is even more disturbing. However, I don't buy your ignorance. I did my research on your water supply after we left, now I know why you supply a few water bottles for customers....certainly not because you know your water is garbage, right??? This place is a joke and management is even worse. I will be sure to share your reply on every travel site possible.

Ambiance is stellar, large enough to accommodate my family of 7. The staff was very attentive and generous with the bread! Also he was very helpful with wine selections (both per glass and per bottle) and deciding with appetizers without having left overs of appetizers which is always good and lets us save room for dinner. We also were able to get little bit of history of the restaurant and the original owners and the current owners as well as the menu and the building. My family then ordered dinner, including vegetarian pastas, seafood, lamb and chicken entrees. Everyone was VERY happy with quantity and quality of food, all entrees were very well sized, and flavorful and had a good amount of the main dish. For my family that means that they were not ripped off with small portions of their meat or fish and it was fresh and good quality meat or fish. 

We were there to celebrate so when I ordered spumoni, which was very good and fresh, they brought it out with a candle and were accommodating for my large group and refilling our water glasses even after we paid the bill. 

The manager had come by towards the end to see what we thought and asked if we had any suggestions or concerns (obviously we had none) lol. The current owner later came and greeted us and even had a conversation with us about the history of the restaurant and the menu and told us that she and her husband have owned it for about 25 years and they try to preserve it as best as they can.

My contact was John Fries in the Indianapolis office. (He goes by the nickname JR.) JR told me that they are low stress movers. This turned out to be true. Before the move, I didn't know him at all. If I had known him better, I would have brought up and discussed some other options with him and they would have made my move even more stress free. (For instance, I wish that I had brought up with him the option of them moving our car.)  I called him rather late in the process. He came right away, looked at the contents of my apartment in Indiana, and gave me a price that was very competitive. 

On the moving day, they came on time and did a good job of moving.  Did everything go perfectly? No. The driver did not know that the contents of my garage have to be moved. JR knew this but this was not communicated to the driver. There was room in the truck but the driver would have preferred to load in a different order if he knew that the garage contents also have to be moved.  He complained and there was some unpleasantness. I wish that I had anticipated this problem and given the driver a list of all the rooms that need to be moved.  

On the receiving end, I had the same driver for the unloading. My apartment in North Carolina screwed up in getting the apartment ready for unloading.  This certainly was NOT Here To There Movers' fault. Understandably, the driver complained again. However, I wish that he had been a little more flexible and given me more options when there was a delay, possibly at an additional charge. He did not.  However, in spite of these two problems, everything was moved well. I gave the driver a good tip. (Looking back, I probably was a bit overly generous.)

I came here when they first opened and the first thing I noticed was the grill. which is off of the parking lot, fired up. It was smelling very good.  The dining area is nice and well decorated. They have TVs playing Jamaican music videos and looks like that have an area for live music. The menu is straight snd to the point and has goat, ox tail, ribs and chicken.

Wife and I remodeled our kitchen, and we purchased a range, wall oven, dishwasher, and fridge from Gerhard's.  They have an excellent selection of products, including carrying Blue Star appliances which was the main draw for us.  Pricing wasn't horrible either, the showroom was pleasant, and the sales people mostly helpful.  I was also keen on the idea of a family owned and operated store, and it helped that the salesperson working with us was a Gerhard.  So we had no reservations moving forward with significant purchases.

The first of many issues came when it was time to take delivery of the items.  We got a call a couple weeks before informing us that all items were in and ready to be delivered.  So we worked with our contractor to schedule delivery and ensure his team was available to direct the appliances where they needed to go and begin installation.  While the delivery did come on time, only half of the items were on the truck!  To top it off, the wrong model dishwasher was delivered, and before anyone realized it, the appliance was installed and operational.  It was a pain in the ass fixing that mixup, and involved a 1.5 month long process involving at least two phone calls a week.  

Upon learning that only half of the items were delivered, a phone call to Gerhard's resulted in sorry, your sales person no longer works for the company (so much for being a family business!!!!) and ""we don't know what happened.  We'll call you back.""  This was the first of many no call backs.  Big strike against customer service there.  Ultimately, the impression given was that the items that weren't delivered weren't even ordered!  Gerhard's also cared less that my contractor and team were at a standstill on my dime, and that their time and my money was completely wasted due to their disorganization.  While I wouldn't have been thrilled with acknowledgment of a screwup before scheduling delivery, a bit of honesty on their end could have spared me wasted time and money.

Three weeks later, the same phone call comes: all of your items are ready for delivery.   All of them, I ask?  ""All of them.  We promise.""  Same routine: get crew on site day of delivery for quick turn around.  This time, however, Gerhard's delivery fails to show up!!!!!  It took multiple calls to their warehouse to figure out what was going on, but not a soul had any idea.  Yes: you are scheduled for delivery before 4PM today.  Oh, it's already 4PM?  Let me call the driver.  Sorry, the driver is busy, call I call you back?  You know the routing by now.  Ultimately, I gave up waiting, and told them to schedule delivery for the next day so I could send the crew home.  

Fortunately, Gerhard's delivery service did show up the next day as promised. 
Unfortunately, it was groundhog day: not all of the items were delivered, yet again!  Come on... really? Not much time was wasted on the contractor's end this time around as the big items were delivered, just not the dishwasher from the earlier fiasco, but still.  Another call to Gerhard's resulted in a ""we don't know what happened.""  Knowing it would be another multiple call effort to sort through the details, I ended up driving to the store and picking up the item myself.  

AND IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH, though I paid for the appliances up front in full (mistake on my part... all of my leverage was gone, and I couldn't simply say forget it: keep the appliances and I'm going elsewhere), I later received a bill telling me that a charge that was waived by the original sales person with the last name of Gerhard's who no longer works there was being added back to the bill.  WTF?  This item is still unresolved, and I'm not happy about it in the least.

Bottom line, Gerhard's is disorganized and does not have the skill set or training required to properly deal with customers and fix their own mistakes--of which there were many in my experience.  Go elsewhere.",20,d3bee3DH0oYGMc7esLOq0g

When booking an appointment, specify what you're looking for and what level of pressure you prefer.

Seeing the Pacers' game in ""Bankers Life Fieldhouse was a fun and memorable experience.  Although they lost to the Magic by a few points, the Pacers secured a place for the 2019 playoff.  

""Bankers Life Fieldhouse,"" overall, gave me a ""boutique"" vibe.  Entering through security was effortless and efficient.  I also noticed that people could pass the checkpoint and then purchase the tickets instead having to do it outside.  That was a nice touch and it would probably avoid grumpy customers who didn't deal with the cold well. 

Our seats were at the 200 level, next to the handicap accessible zone.  Being at the row 3 provided clear views on all the actions happening down in the court.  The audio, sound effects, Pacemates dancers, entertainment, and interactive games were good.  In addition, one interesting fact caught my attention while at the game.  The audience was nice and courteous.  Why did I mention this?  The Chicagoans, especially the ones born and raised in the city, tend to be raw, edgy, and brutally honest (sometimes this is a good thing).  I think I observed a cultural shift in Indianapolis.  A 3-hour drive away sent us to a total different world and a brand new vibe!  

We also claimed our free poster at the marketing booth since it was our first Pacers' game.  The game itself was competitive and exciting.  Even though we didn't purchase any food or beverage, the prices were what one would expect in any other sports arena, fields, or complexes.  

I am a bit ashamed to say that ""Bankers Life Fieldhouse"" is better curated than the United Center, home of the Chicago Bulls.

I looked on line for what was listed as best in Plant City and it seemed 813 was the place to go. I ordered the combo of both the general tso chicken and the orange chicken and steamed dumplings. The combo came with egg rolls which was tasty and not overly greasy, The steamed dumplings was also good but whatever was crunchy inside surprised me. I assume it was chopped cabbage. The free iced tea was also good even though I prefer iced tea without sugar or lemon or ice. By the end of the iced tea I was feeling a little sugar over load, but flavor wise was better then many iced teas I've had in the past.

The problem is the two dinners, the general tso chicken and the orange chicken. When I placed the order I specifically asked that both were spicy (as listed on the menu) but when I got home and tasted both not only were they not spicy but tasted exactly the same. If it wasn't for finding one tiny piece of orange peel in one of them I would had thought they had given me two of the same dinners instead of one of each.

The flavor of each was bland, the chicken in each was strong flavored with some gristle so was some cheap dark meat thigh or drumstick meat. Considering the price I would had expected they would had used better chicken meat. 

The amount of food in each dinner was less then other places which makes the value even less. Well so much for finding a Chinese takeout that is better then my usual place. I'll keep going to my usual takeout place and never order from here again.",0,mieQq03Sx0VIF4B4ZeoWWg

Service was very very casual dining. I believe we were there for about 3 hours total. 

Beef Wellington Bites had great flavor but not the texture we were expecting. We expected a cube of beef inside but instead it was a creamy texture. Imagine if you will creamy Hamburger Helper wrapped in a pastry shell. Hamburger Helper is probably not what you would have come to mind at this price point, but I was my first thought.  The Cheese Steak Egg Rolls would have been great minus the horseradish. The Ceaser Salad seriously could have been cut up, but the dressing was amazing, croutons a bit too hard. My 12 oz Filet came out too red and had to be sent back. I think that is why I forgot to get a photo. The steak had a great char and seasoning 12oz is a lot of meat. We got sides of Mac N Cheese and Cheese Potatoes which were both great.   Bananas Foster was just ok. It did not have the punch of banana I was expecting.

Like others the manager Will told her they wouldn't be a ""good fit"" going forward. I though this was odd but I hadn't had a complaint before so I thought this was an isolated incident or misunderstanding until I had a concern one day. I had the company booked weekly to get my home ready to sell and I scheduled a deep clean the week before it was out on the market. A wire must have been crossed because there was definitely no deep clean done. My realtor told me I needed to have the cleaning redone because there was dust everywhere. I'd never had a complaint so I sent Will a message with my concerns. He essentially accused me of lying. ""I find that incredibly difficult to believe, did you take pictures."" I was really offended by the accusation so I told him I would just book a deep cleaning with another company. He seemed thrilled to see me go. I was perfectly prepared to take them with me in my move for biweekly cleanings and Will would rather throw away that business over one dispute. I hate it for the hard workers that the company is so poorly managed and their manager Will, who clearly had an anger problem, keeps throwing away business over petty reasons.

We made a reservation, which we didn't really need as it was quite slow at 7:30 on a Sunday. No one was at the door to greet us and we did wait a few minutes. The dining room has a warm and cozy atmosphere. Unfortunately, a large party took most of our server's attention, and our service was not what I expect from a steakhouse like this. In my experience, The Keg and Fleming's service blow Sullivan's out of the water.

I decided on the prime rib special, which was a 12 oz. cut with horseradish mashed potatoes. My husband got a filet. I tried his steak and it was good, but this prime rib is the best I've had in my life! It was seriously so delicious. There is no need for au jus, because the meat itself is so tender and juicy. So I would HIGHLY recommend the prime rib, plus you get potatoes, and all the sides here are a la carte. We also got green salads, which were good. We did order a side of broccoli for $10 and were disappointed. It was three large broccoli crowns that had been steamed. They didn't have much flavor but came with hollandaise on the side. Meh, it seemed a little low brow next to my amazing prime rib. My husband thought it would be nice if they served broccolini, and I'd agree. I'd suggest choosing another accompaniment if you go. If you want a veggie, maybe stick with salad or get the asparagus?

For the price, I expected better service, but perhaps it was an off night. I'd definitely give Sullivan's another try in the future. Honestly, that prime rib is so good, I'm not sure I want to try any other steak!",0,ZsmLWcqUD5Z8x4CNT9pPTQ

The food was okay. We came for brunch and SURPRISE! There is no brunch, even though it's on the website and the employees told us that there hasn't been brunch for awhile.
Negative. 
I ended up with wings & pizza. Antithesis of brunch. Both we recommended by the waitress. 

Everyone thought the food was okay enough to come back and try again. I waited almost an hour for the pizza. I ordered first in my party, the place was not busy when we ordered, and other guests at other tables received their pizza before me. And all of the people at my table (6 of them) were finished eating by the time my pizza arrived. WTH?


Desserts were ordered and I highly recommend the S'mores. OMG. Serious.

This is definitely a grab and go place, but they do have a couple stools at a bar at the front and a couple of little tables outside so you can choose to sit here and chat with a friend if you like. I sat here with Yelp Marketing Intern, Courtney, for half an hour and it didn't feel weird at all. They even have free wifi! 

I am not a juice person, but I do have a hard time getting veggies into my diet (don't we all?) Therefore, the idea of jam packing a ton of vegetables into a tolerable drink really appeals to me. The best part is the drink was more than tolerable, it was, dare I say, refreshing and delicious! Since it was our first time an employee walked us through their juices. She said the Simple Greens and the Daily Mean Greens are their two most popular juices. Since I was looking for a green drink anyways I decided to try the Daily Mean Green. They also had a variety of healthy grab and go food, like chia pudding and cold soba. 

The juice is about $10. Yes, it is on the pricier side but you can really taste the quality. Sometimes I wonder if I can put a price on my health. Honestly, if this is a way that I can get more vegetables into my diet so I can feel better during the day then I think it is worth the money. I have the exercise part down, but I'm still working on my diet. 

The best way I can describe the Daily Mean Green is inoffensive, which probably doesn't sound like a strong endorsement, but it is. It was surprisingly light and refreshing. I didn't feel like I was packing my body full of fibrous greens. It also didn't taste overwhelmingly like apple or lemon, like some juices do to try to overcompensate for the greens. I could probably drink it every day.

They came out from Edison, in July 2011 for a flood in my basement. They were sent by my insurance co. And they sucked the water of the furniture, and carpet. And said everything is fine. The basement started to smell like mold immediately. At that time, I knew nothing about mold (they should have thrown the furniture out, and pulled up carpet, but didn't). Then 1yr later, I had another pipe burst in the basement. They came the next day, sucked up the water. By the next day, the basement was smelling, very badly. I called my insurance, and they both came out. Lifted part of the carpet, drilled holes in the sheet rock, at baseboard level, but blowers. A few days later smell was even worse. Back again. Had to pull up all the carpet. They sprayed chemicals all over the floor an inch and a half thick, AND as a FAVOR TO ME they said they sprayed lemon/lime chemicals, on top of the chemicals, to MASK THE SMELL, and left. They said it would kill the mold. My asthma flared up, and I had to call my dr. For an inhaler, and I haven't needed one for at lest 15yrs. My cats (11 of them) immediately started to throw up, and continued to do so until the sun came up. I should have called poison control or the police. I was so dizzy, nauseous, and shaking. I called 1st thing the next morning, to report it, and was yelled at by 
Alan, ""LADY LEAVE THE WINDOWS CLOSED! YOU'R UNDOING WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO!!. And kept yelling that I didn't know what I was talking about, he said there was nothing wrong, they knew what they were doing etc. I started to cry and hung up on him. This went on for a few months, allowing the Sheetrock, insulation, pressboard, and air to continue to grow mold. I paid an air quality co. To come, and she walked in and IMMEDIATLY smelled mold AT THE FRONT DOOR! Found it behind the walls that had gotten soaked and all else. Took samples to lab, results came back for several types, plus AIRBORNE spores. Insurance had to hire a REAL mold remediators, for $10,000. Restore core used up thousands of the insurance money, doing the wrong things. I asked the air quality person about this situation and she said the furniture last yr should have been thrown out, and the walls etc. all porous materials have to be discarded within 48hrs, because that's all the time it takes for mold to grow. They continually dragged their feet, wasting time, and money, insisting they did the right thing, and I can't pay the remainder of the bill to the real remediators.

It is this burger that brought me to Phil's Grill.  At happy hour one day, my coworker discussed how angry his wife was every time he went to Phil's Grill and I discovered why: The Fat City.  I needed, craved, had to eat that burger.  What could be better?
When I finally sunk my teeth into the burger about the size of my head, I was not disappointed.  Although the fried breading around the burger tends to crackle and fall during the eating, the burger has everything you could want on a bun.

The Anesthesiologist came out & asked my wife why I did not disclose my AFIB  - she told him she told Brooke Johnson about it he changed subject & said I had to be taken to Emergency Room/Hospital to see if they could stabilize my heart, but they could not. I was then transported to Morton Plant Cardiac unit for 2 days etc etc.
Not only was I dealing with pain from surgery - I was dealing with permanent AFIB. Upon my follow up visit for surgery, Brooke Johnson hid away - no apology, nothing.

The atmosphere is nice somewhat ""soho-ish"" with a cozy feel.  The service was average and since we arrived early and the place only about 1/3 full I was a bit taken aback.

We ordered a vegetable appetizer which was only warm and the grilled octopus was chewy.  For entres the chicken with capers was overcooked and not a single caper to be found.  Reminded me of a boiled chicken breast tossed on a plate.   I had had the duck which was also overcooked and lacking in flavor.

The wine selection was also average but with a heavy markup. A $25 bottle was about $100.  The Italian wines selection was better (as you would imagine) it was not great.   

I don't think much about the cost of a fine meal unless it is sub-par.  This was just plain amateur bad.

Perhaps it was a bad night but when dinner for 2 is over $200 I do not believe in second chances.  When you play at that level consistency is king.  Vetri should investigate why his kitchen is up and down.

Friend said the bagel was good, but they only give a small amount of lox. 

The mushroom onion burek tasted mostly like mushroom, flaky but sort of flavorless.

The tour lasts about an hour and a half.  The house is amazingly accurate as far as the time period.  They have most of the furnishings and artifacts saved from the family.  The top floor serves as a museum with infromation and artifacts from his presidency.

Upon arriving, Charles said they were more than able to carry out what I had requested and gave me an excellent price for the work to be formed. I signed off on it and waited.

During the completion and work being performed, would would have been a relatively easy installation and fabrication, turned into a nearly five hour mess and a total disaster of crooked welds, poor fitment, and the use of a tie straps just to bend everything into place due to poor fabrication, measurements, and craftsmanship.

I was visibly frustrated and made it quite clear how unhappy I was with the work performed, especially since they mounted the rear muffler section back up pinching against and making direct contact with my vehicle's rear bumper and diffuser, completely crooked, and an entire side unsecure and not even installed properly to the chassis via the factory hanger and rubber mount. Rather than taking down and re-doing the sections they had fabricated with jagged welds, poor angles, and sloppy craftsmanship, they then proceeded to further butcher other sections of the axle back muffler section and tear into things further. I was told, ""Oh, it's because it's aftermarket, it's hard to fit,"" and to just ""Bring it back on Monday and we will fix it"" since they took longer than expected and complained that they had already been there longer than they should be.

First off, there's two sections that are aftermarket, that being a dual resonator off the main X mid pipe running from the downpipes followed by an X pipe. The poor fitment, installation, and fabrication were performed by their team and their shop, thus the poor fitment of said components are due to poor craftsmanship, not the fact that they are aftermarket components. The vehicle arrived in excellent condition with absolutely no issues to now leaving in horrible condition with damage to the rear bumper diffuser, bent and damaged bumper tabs, and a non-secured rear muffler section freely hanging and dangling on one entire side. Additionally, there are sections of the fabricated pieces and sections resting and making direct contact with the undercarriage and chassis, resulting in obnoxious vibrations and sounds throughout the cabin and exterior of the vehicle.

I called on Monday, May 6th, to see when I could bring the vehicle back down to have it corrected as I was originally promised. Rather than the manager answering, another member of the team did and informed me that the only individual who was capable of welding was not even in that day, thus leaving me to further drive with a messed up exhaust continuing to inflict further damage on the rear bumper and diffuser, not even including the direct contact off pinching against the undercarriage and heat shielding or the fact it's still freely hanging on one entire side.

I've reached out to corporate which then told me to file a complaint via their online form system which would be relayed to the owner of this specific location and still have received no responses. Furthermore, to further avoid any additional issues and damage, I've made the costly decision to bring the vehicle to an actually qualified welder and shop, thus rather than just fabricating and installing the minor work that I had additionally approached this Midas team for, I will now be paying out of pocket for virtually the entire exhaust to be repaired from the catastrophe generated by this Midas location.

I will be taking the steps necessary to recoup costs associated with this Midas branch and the horrid results and disaster they created.

Response to Business's Response: I've already filled the contact form out and still have received zero response whatsoever. The vehicle is now with an actual professional, for which I will now be needing to pay not only for the original work your team was to perform, but now to have all the damage you created repaired.

The ball has been in your court and I see no attempts to even dribble it or acknowledge it being there.

Update: Picked my vehicle up from the new shop. Total cost to re-fabricate and repair the work performed by Midas, along with properly install the original parts I had requested, came to $609.50. The new fabricator took pictures of the ""fabrication"" work done by the team at Midas, and it ain't pretty... Images attached.",0,mKiiKLHqc1hsq79wLYB1aA

  Ate here 2x in 90's and it was incredible, so I had high expectations returning some 15 years later.   
  So here's the breakdown....
   - Bread was warm and butter/spread was soft and creamy.
   - Salads were crisp and fresh (had iceberg wedge & caesar & mixed green). 
   - Wait staff was attentive and friendly (5 of us drank water and wished they would have just given us larger glasses as we seemed to be getting refills every 2 minutes).
   - Potatoes Au Gratin were fabulous - better than any I have ever had
   - Macaroni 'n Cheese was unique and tasty - not Kraft from a box
   - Sautéed spinach was good, but portion seemed small
  Steaks....we had mixed reviews at our table
   - Prime Rib 18oz - pretty basic, but better than 90% of most you will ever eat.
   - New York Strip was very, very good. Person said it was fabulous, top 5 ever!
   - Barrel Cut Filet w/béarnaise sauce was one of the best steaks person ever ate
   - Standard Filet - not very tasty and not very attractive
   - Dry Aged Bone in Ribeye - an $89 steak folks! Very unique and flavored steak as dry aged process is not something you get at most places.  
  Dessert was Tuxedo Torte and it was absolutely delicious!  Incredible !
   Thought it was interesting that for a party of 6 they added a 20% gratuity to my check for 4 and to the check for the other 2 at the table as well.  Is it standard to add gratuity to parties of 6?
   This place is very expensive, so be prepared.

We normally get the El Capitan Dinner which comes with your choice of two sides, two hush puppies and sauce.  We get the fried fish and it is delicious.  They give you two large pieces of fillet.  It can be a bit (but not excessively) greasy.  Once we receive our order, we take the fish out of the serving basket and place it on paper napkins.  The fish is very tasty.  When we go for lunch, I am usually full after only one of the two fish fillets.  I take the second fillet home for lunch the next day. It heats up ok (not great or like it was on the first day.... But ok) in the oven when sprinkled with a bit of water.  

For sides, we like the fried okra, green beans, red beans and rice, and the waffle fries.  The hush puppies are nicely seasoned.  The sauce.... Oh, my!  The sauce is absolutely wonderful.  It is not your typical tarter sauce.  It used to look like it was made right there in the fish market.  It was packaged in clear carry out, non-labeled, small plastic containers like you would put salad dressing in at a salad bar.  My perception was it was made there and with fresh ingredients.  (I asked for the recipe once and they provided a list of all fresh items).  However, now it is in a sealed pre-manufactured container with a preprinted foil label.   This new manufactured product lists the ingredients and it shows what appears to be preservatives and the like (not normal sounding kitchen ingredients).  The taste was very similar to the old sauce but I was disappointed to see what appeared to be a less ""fresh"" type of product.  It still was good .... Just disappointing.

Pricing is moderate, not inexpensive but not outrageous.  The El Capitan is listed as a dinner item and is $10.99.  Sandwiches are around $7.99 and individual side items in the regular size are $1.99.   Historically, they have had coupons in the Entertainment Book.

When walking in, they have 2 sides, one for pizza and one for chicken. They were packed to the max and it was 2 am! We were in line for about 20 minutes. I ordered the 2 piece white with fries and a side of red beans and rice. I don't remember the price because I was still a bit tipsy from all the shots I took on bourbon. They give you a number and you place it on your table for them to bring it out to you.

The chicken arrived hot and crispy, like I like it. Some people in line were asking us how it tasted and what we ordered. The chicken was juicy and seasoned all the way through, the biscuit seemed to be only the biscuit top and it was really soft. The fries were seasoned well also. The red beans and rice weren't as good as the ones I had tasted earlier in the day, but they were hot as well.

They collected a $70,000 deposit and began the excavation and sprayed the gunite immediately and then everything went down hill. I couldn't get a hold of the project manager for months to clean up the disaster and dangerous debris they left in my yard..including a pile of very sharp rebar, rocks, pvc pipes, excess coping and tile and stone. I finally got someone to come out and move on to the next step, which was the stone veneer on the waterfall wall and underground drainage. The drains were clearly not installed correctly causing my yard and now my neighbors yard to completely flood during heavy rains...so bad that my neighbors shed is about to fall onto my fence. And the same guy installed the incorrect stone on the wall...refused to change it to the correct stone or refund my money...just offered to correct the poor workmanship! He was then fired from the job and another landscaper came in to clean up the yard and install the pavers. He attempted to correct the drains but to no avail. After reaching out to the fence company myself, I got them to come install my fence but I have to pay extra to have the existing fence removed which they apologized the Sylvan left off the contract. The plumber then came to install the water bowls on the stone wall but the original stone guy never attached the blue stone tops so he left the bowls in my garage and left.

Sure enough, last month I did just that during our visit to Philly, and the Garces Events staff spent the prior 6 months helping me to plan the perfect proposal and celebration there.  The food was delicious, the wine was wonderful, and it was truly a night to remember.

I recently stopped by to return some Christmas gifts that unfortunately didn't fit quite right. A nice clerk offered to hold the items for me while I shopped. With $70 in store credit, I scoured the store. Since I also had a $10 gift card, I hoped to find $80-worth of stuff to be done with it.

After almost an HOUR of listening to catchy clubbin' tunes and slogging through both post-Christmas hoards and clothes strewn about everywhere, I was still empty-handed. Why? Everything in the store was hideous. I guess I can't fault Forever 21 for simply churning out the latest trends. But do you know how hard it is to find $80-worth of ugly crap at fall-apart-when-they're-out-of-style prices? Maddening. Which also is kind of frightening... am I just too old for the latest trends? Am I not... FOREVER 21?! 

I did finally manage to find a few things, and then even better things in the small athletic items section. I got a surprisingly well-made looking sports tank and pullover. Otherwise, some pluses were the short fitting room line, long checkout line that moved super fast, and friendly though slightly harried staff. And with $22 in store credit AND the gift card remaining, I guess I can't quit you yet, Forever 21.",0,WYimstZR9vsXZqggoujPNQ

The sense that the menu has changed only incrementally, with the addition of the Jack Daniel's brand on half the menu (not that you can taste any JD). Booth after booth of high school daters, convention attendees, and families. TGI Friday's is comfortable, friendly, and reasonably priced. Especially if you stick with the specials, which I did not.

I pushed my 8 year old through the door. He said it was too ""authentic"". Apparently the over-branding of the word ""authentic"" has come to mean corporate to him. He said there were too many pictures. But then he said he liked them. Ahh, the mind of a child. Anyway, after eating he's decided that Friday's is now his favorite. Right up there with Chili's. I'm sure he'd throw 5 stars to Applebees and Ruby Tuesday too. We don't have a Bennigans or a Houlihan's anymore. And that place on Sidco that everybody used to love - what was it called? It's an antique store now. He would have LOVED it.

Anyway, Friday's in comfort food. Not particularly innovative or even especially well executed. We started with the requisite Potato skins. Wonderful terrible potato skins. A happy indulgence. The bigger boy and I shared a rack of ""Jack Daniel's"" ribs. I'm not sure that I tasted any JD.  Perhaps they cooked a few drops in to every gallon of Cattlemen's sweet sauce at some point. The ribs were typical of chain restaurant BBQ. Braised and finished on the grill. Yes, fall off the bone. I don't like using a fork to eat my ribs. The ginger lime slaw was good.

I sometimes lose my voice when public speaking and needed someone to help me work out my vocal cords as a trainer. John made me feel welcome at my evaluation and has an excellent approach to vocal coaching. While in his studio in Manayunk, you will feel comfortable, and guided rather than judged and ashamed. He encourages the things you do well and simply corrects the things you are missing or incorrectly performing by modeling the correct way without missing a beat. He is also very interesting and takes the time to know who you are and the direction you're headed in with your vocal needs. He has a wide array of knowledge and has taught me more than how to work and train my vocal cords. From John I have learned about being grateful, about recognizing and embracing differences, about setting boundaries in a safe way, about letting go of things that don't work and strategically utilizing what you have while you look for the next thing you want. He is more than a vocal coach, but a mentor as well. He is honest and helpful in developing those willing and able to learn. I'm grateful to have found such a wonderful human being , let alone coach to give my money to. It is well worth the price. Also, sessions are individualized for who you are, your current skill and what you want to learn as well as timing of the session.

The Two-Step Chopped salad was the only thing that was okay. It definitely wasn't a chopped salad - just a regular salad full leafs and all.

We arrived a little after 11 (on a Monday) and the place was wide open but there was only one other party dining in the establishment. The food was absolutely scrumptious. I had the chicken fajitas and they were delicious, they weren't soggy (as my biggest complaint about fajitas some time that they've been cooked in way too much oil). The chicken was nicely cooked and the veggies were crispy & flavorful. I was able to eat the whole entree--beans, rice & fajitas included! I think this dish was $14, I wouldn't expect leftovers or recommend splitting. Plenty for 1 person. My friend had the jicama tacos and I was blown away at how yummy those were too. The menu isn't extensive, but everyone was happy with their food. 

The only big drawback is that our service was slow. It took a long time to get our food, and water refills, and our check.

Ordered my usual two large ice coffees. Not usual for me, I asked for almond milk as the wifey prefers it. When the order came, the milk was visibly separated and looked curdled. Yuk!  Coffee should not have texture...

I asked my barista, and he says ""no, almond milk and soy milk just naturally separate.""  Hmmm... this does not happen when we use  almond milk at home. I ask wifey, and she says, ""yeah, it separates when it gets rancid, and that's what happens when they don't go through much of it.""  I have to say I trust wifey on this one, and six other people at DI ball field seem to agree. 

Regardless, the coffee tastes terrible.  I don't know if it is spoiled milk or just really bitter coffee.  As cool as the style and sophistication is for this new establishment, the bottom line is that the product must be excellent.  At $12.95 plus tip for two 16 oz coffees (w plenty of ice), anything less than a perfectly executed product is really unacceptable.

I was a little lost on how to order the hot sub the first time I came in because I thought they would ask me what additinoal toppings I wanted on it, i.e. tomato, etc, when it was done on the grill, but you actually tell them all of the toppings or any mods when you initally order at the begininng of the line. I watched people with cold subs at the toppings counter so it confused me a bit. When they handed me my sub already wrapped up and I expressed my confusion, they were happy to make me a small tray of cold toppings I could add later. Great customer service.

Each visit,   I ordered my chipotle steak sandwich on wheat bread which was surprising soft and fluffy for wheat with a great flavor. I didn't have to wait too long for it to be made to order. All 4x I've been here, the sandwich has been consistently flavorful and very fresh tasting. The melted cheese and chipotle sauce comes together beautifully to finsih the flavor.

Table is associated with the attached upscale Market grocery store. It has its separate entrance. The restaurant is set in modern lines, muted tones, understated lighting. Tables are well apart for low noise and easy conversation. On both Friday and Saturday nights there were solo guitarists in the bar area who contributed to the refined atmosphere in the rest of the restaurant. 

The menu offers enough variety to provide something for all but the pickiest eater. We enjoyed everything we ordered, which over two nights included an appetizer, a sandwich, an entree salad and a couple of main courses. 

The best example of the quality, innovation and preparation of food was the roasted organic chicken, sampled on both nights. The breast, thigh and leg were redolent (I always wanted to use that word in a review) with rosemary and thyme. It is rotisserie-cooked perfectly with good color on the skin and the breast still moist, not dry. It was served with a creamy ""risotto-style"" brown rice, a white sauce, and seasonal vegetables. I suspect the cooks survey for the best vegetables of the day; on Friday the vegetables were yellow pattypan squash and thin asparagus and on Saturday they were true baby carrots and baby beets.

Prices are equal or lower than themed chain restaurants where patrons are packed in closer, noise levels higher, and food is prepared ""by the numbers."" 

Servers are pleasant, enthusiastic, and experienced. I promised our excellent Saturday server a shoutout - Thanks and great job, Patrick!

Our bartender/waitress was Calla and she was so kind and knowledgeable. We ordered food and drinks and not once did she make us feel rushed or treat us as a nuisance. 

We only realized that they closed at 12am not 2am when we finally looked around and realized we were one of the only people in the entire restaurant. I just wanted to say kudos to your amazing service and sorry to the kitchen for not realizing sooner.

Free Range Cookies is a gluten-free bakery that has a little of everything. Cookies, Breads, Brownies, Cupcakes, you name it. 

They also have a number of VEGAN goodies! Since I'm going vegan for the month of March, this is a big deal to me. 

I tried the vegan mint chocolate cookies, and they were delicious -- they taste JUST like Thin Mints! And they definitely satisfied this girls craving for the popular Girl Scout cookie (Girl Scout Thin Mints aren't vegan, by the way). 

I also tried the cranberry oatmeal cookie (amazing) and the quinoa cookie (hands down, the BEST cookie I've ever had!). The cookies are HUGE and delicious.

If you can get over the fact that the nearest parking requires backing in at an angle, you'll love Hawthorne's. Going for brunch on the weekend? Be prepared for a wait. I would say that 30 minutes seemed about average for those of us waiting for a table for 2. If you've got 4 or more in your party, plan on wait times closer to 1 hour. The restaurant does accept reservations for parties of 6 or more for weekend brunch. Yes, your ENTIRE party must be present before you will be seated. 

Don't fret, though, because you can mosey on over to the cold cases while you wait and select from quite an impressive collection of beers (and ciders) to sip on while you wait. They also have great stuff on draught. Your wait time will also give you the opportunity to consider the multitude of make-your-own-six pack options. 10% off a carry-out six pack, 15% off for an eight pack. Growlers are also available for carry-out.

I started with the Petrus Aged Ale which is a sour/wild ale that had a nice, crisp tang to it. At 7.3%, I was definitely in need of some hearty food by the time I finished the glass. The biscuits and gravy immediately spoke to me as soon as I saw the menu. Maybe it's the realization that Monday starts the work week that makes you feel like you are eating the best (and last) meal of your life at Sunday brunch, but this plate really was delicious - flaky, buttery, biscuits topped with two fried eggs and a generous heaping of creamy sausage gravy with crispy home fries on the side. I was really impressed by the gravy which was rich, thick, and flavorful with actual chunks of sausage. Everything on the plate mixes together so well so that you get a truly tremendous forkful of biscuit, egg, potato, and gravy. You won't need to eat for the rest of the day! A Founders Breakfast Stout really rounded out things. 

A little known fact: BYO vodka or champagne and they'll mix up Bloody Mary's or Mimosas for you.

The tables are close and cozy so don't expect to break up with your guy or gal here unless you want the whole restaurant to know. The fireplace (and the beer) will keep you nice and warm during your meal. The service was very friendly and quick. Our food took less than 30 minutes to come out of the kitchen, piping hot. While seated, you can grab a beer from their cooler and it will be added to your bill - pretty convenient.

I am very disappointed in your establishment.  So disappointed in fact I am moving you down to one star.  Below are the reasons why and why I am being slightly unfair.

1. The only reason I am being slightly unfair is that the food here is so freaking good! All of it.  Seriously.

2. Why I am disappointed in you: Contrary to popular belief, my first night here was not training night.  The wait staff is just that bad.  I get it. You don't want to have to pay people a lot, so you take from the bottom of the barrel.  But I swear to god, next time I have awful service here I am not tipping.

3. My best friend recently called you to make a reservation for 12 people for her fiancee's birthday.  You accepted said reservation.  When she called to confirm the Monday before, she was told that she did not have a reservation because there was a private party going on that night.  I am very impressed that one of your staff had the nerve to take the reservation, not write it down, and never call her back.  Luckily for you, Boogaloo a few doors down was happy to take a reservation with less than a weeks notice for such a large group.  

Seriously, I am not sure if the management here all has short term memory loss (think Memento style loss), or if it is really run by a group of chimps in the back room (think those old career builder ads http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YR71GnQ4CU4), but either way, get it together.

My husband went in to pick up an order, paid for it, and waited. While he was waiting, he asked if he could have some eel sauce added to the order. The cashier brought the order with the eel sauce, and a manager followed her over to tell her that she needed to charge him an extra dollar for that sauce. Since he had already paid using his debit card, he gave her $1 cash. Somehow that got lost in translation, because the manager then charged our debit card again for what the new total would be had he not paid the $1 cash. In essence, he changed the amount on our receipt after my husband signed for it, which is illegal. Both the first charge and his updated charge are still pending on our account a week later, so I'm guessing one will drop off, but this whole debacle required hours of phone tag and a lengthy conversation once we finally found someone who spoke English to help us.

The restaurant is old school with a very simple yet scrumptious menu. It can be tough to get a seat as their is often a line outside. My recommendation is to come for an early lunch and avoid the longer lines. We started off with some red beans and rice and cornbread. The red beans and rice are excellent and well seasoned, but came out a bit cold. The other bean option looked amazing though. I think I will have to go with those next time. 

The star of the show was the chicken of course. I got a 3 piece meal. It was perhaps one of the best fried chicken dishes I have ever had. The chicken breading alone is enough to have me back waiting in line. The breading has a wonderful crunch and perfect blend of seasoning and spice. It is not too oily or too dry, just perfect!  The chicken is juicy and amazing as well. The oil from the breading doesn't make its way to the chicken and it is very well made.

We both ordered fish. Me: the Flounder. Him: The catch of the day , an Australian(?) Sea bass.  All I can say is, when the food came out,  it was lackluster. No pizazz. I don't know what I was expecting, but  I could not believe how overcooked the asparagus was - it was limp and greasy looking.  Like, seriously?

My flounder was forgettable and boring.  Boyfriend's  Australian Sea bass was fishy. It actually tasted as if it were frozen. It was horrible. Again, what was I expecting? I don't know. Just not this.

We are in Philly, how can the Italian food get this bad?! How?! 

Because it was all just so boring, I shifted my gaze to the party of 8 next to us. I noticed when they had come in because they were a big, happily loud, fun-looking group. Anyway, they had been sitting for about 10 minutes and no one had come to open their wine. Ugh. They were getting annoyed. 

At that point, I just looked at the boyfriend, who had already managed to get the check. It was getting busy, and the waiters were flustered. We dropped the cash, and hightailed it out of there as fast as we could. 

Maybe it was a really, really, really off day. But if you ask me, please do your palette and wallet a favor and steer clear of this place.",2,r1WefBOIn1q72UEzUk5Ryg

They have a lot of classic literature titles, as well as numerous autographed novels (several Anne Rice novels!). They have a seperate room for the more domestic people out there; those who love to cook and garden, etc. There's another room for old pictures/magazines, as well as bio and autobiographical books.

There's a LOVELY balcony on the second floor that overlooks Main Street, but it's only open in the warmer months of the year.

Downstairs, there's a trolly in the parking lot that dishes up food, which I have not tasted, and several table and chair sets.

There are plenty of UPS stores here in Tucson - do yourself a favor and spend you money at a different one!!!

Story:
I always scan my shipping receipts with my iPhone and usually upload immediately to Dropbox. In this instance, I thought I hadn't yet uploaded to Dropbox. 

So my iPhone goes through a major crash and all of my data is wiped out. I thought that I was missing the tracking receipt number for a package I had recently shipped.

So my lovely girlfriend is out running errands and stops by a UPS store to ask about the package, hoping they might be able to look up the tracking number for us.

So she's at one UPS store near a Walmart, and the employee there is super friendly. Takes her info, offers to text her when she gets a chance to research our problem, etc. That UPS store learns that I had dropped off at THIS UPS store, and said that we needed to check in with this one (since the UPS stores are franchises, owned by different people, different computer systems).

So my girlfriend, once again being the angel that she is, stops in at THIS location.

Instead of being polite, or alternatively simply stating that the store was too busy to help us out, the employee/owner (blonde hair, over-weight) begins to lecture. Asking rhetorical questions such as ""do you know how many packages ship through here on a Saturday?"" and chastising her for not having kept her tracking number.

NOW I don't expect the store to bend over backwards with our issue, really I don't. The lady could have easily stated she was too busy at the moment, and to check back later, whatever. Instead, she actually did look up and locate the tracking number, but not until she had taken her pound of flesh from my girlfriend, which of course upset her.

Lesson for Owner:
Sights like Yelp now exist. We live in a free market society. Hopefully, news of your attitude will spread and you will go out of business! Why on earth did you choose to work in the customer service industry if you can't handle dealing with customers!? We for one will NEVER spend a cent at this location.

I got him addicted last year. WoohoO! I called Oracle Nails because they're close by to see if they could get us in within the hour and they said yes! Double Woohoo!!

Walked in and were greeted right away. The shop was super busy but they had our spa chairs ready to go. Chairs are super comfy...great massaging action of course. My husband, who's a big guy at 6'2"" had a tough time with his long legs, but it worked out fine. 

He also has a problem with ingrown nails that they were super awesome about and helped him out with that as well. Awesome! 

Pedicure, callous scrub, refreshing sea salt leg scrub, massage, cuticles and pretty purple toes for me! He opted for au natural.

I initially went because they advertise $35 and I felt that that was a very reasonable price. However, when I went to check out, my bill was actually $55 because the styler put 3-4 bobby pins in my hair and referred to that as an ""updo"". I did not get my hair washed and was only there for 30 minutes, so I felt like $55 was entirely too much and to have my hair style considered an updo just because she put 3 bobby pins in made me a little upset.

I was seated (btw YOU GET TO PICK WHERE YOU SIT IN THE THEATER!!!) & looked at my menu. I chose a chicken bacon ranch pizza for $12, Yes, $12.

We headed down about a week after they opened (we gave them a few days to figure things out). Firstly, the restaurant seems hip and clean, with plenty of employees standing around. I counted ten seemingly just hanging out when we walked in. We ordered one beer each, chips/salsa, and two burritos. This is where it goes down hill. 

Only one beer came, we had to flag down our server to get the other. The burritos came, a bit small for 9 bucks and left us wanting. The chips never came, so we had to ask for them... twice. The server ""comped"" them.. someone wanted to preserve her tip. The salsa was severely lacking in every way. Ended up using the ""hot sauce"" in the squeeze tubes instead. The chips were very brown and tasted burnt, only in contrast to the light and chewy undercooked ones. 

The burritos: a veggie option and a pork option. The rice was crunchy, and had to spit out a few hard rice grains... watch your teeth. 

All in all, the only thing I would have spent money on was the beer. I should have listened to the google review I read. We have been waiting for this place to open for a very long time and will not be returning. If you are desperate for late night drunk food, just walk the few blocks to Pie Hole.

Unfortunately everyone of us was so disappointed with our lunch experience. It started with an extremely long wait to take our order. It got to the point of joking around that even though we made reservations and sat down we still might not get to eat here if no one takes our order. Once we did order, our salads came out rather quickly however the main course did not. The waitress continually apologized for the wait and told us our orders were placed behind a large party. One of my co-workers commented that the waitress's amount of apologizing is starting to get awkward. When our main course came out, two of the burgers were missing the aioli and one of the burgers was completely different than the rest despite the entire table ordering the same thing. We decided not to send back the wrong food in the interest of returning to work before closing time. The waitress did not return to check on us until most of us had finished more than half the burger. I flagged her down to get a side of the aioli for the burgers missing it and give her a heads up about the wrong burger. She offered to bring out an egg for the burger which it was missing but the co-worker had already finished the burger so he told her that it wasn't necessary. When the dessert came out they served the gluten free member of our party cookie crumbs that were not addressed on the menu. We had to wait for the waitress to confirm with the chef it wasn't gluten free, come back and pick it up from the table and then bring a new one. Our party was completely patient with the entire situation. When the waitress brought our check she gave a little speech thanking us for being so cool since she has been yelled at for much less she told us she was aware there was a lot of mistakes and that she hoped that we will give them another chance. This speech lead me to believe there would be a comp on the check or they would give us a coupon to return at another time but nothing. The manager didn't even come to the table to address us. We paid full price and walked out exclaiming we would never be back. This entire experience was sad and unnecessary.",0,Y8UPYv0AXkHg7hqPaJ9uwQ

Art Cinema specializes in showing independent films including foreign films but they do show something more mainstream now and again as well. They also have special movie showings. For instance, we recently went to an event where they showed all of this year's Academy Award nominated digital shorts. There really isn't any other venue in which to see them so it's a great opportunity to see something that's a little less known.

They have typical movie theater fare -- popcorn, soda, candy. They also have cafe drinks and alcohol can be purchased at a bar that's connected to the theater. A nice touch but we have found that the craft beer prices are high. The service in the bar is friendly however and beer during a movie is a treat so we're willing to pay a bit more. 

Parking on the third level of the parking garage outside the mall seems to be the best bet --it's not covered up there so it's a bit less crowded (though I've not attempted parking there during the holidays). Also, for newer and more in demand titles, get to the theater for seating a half hour before the show.

Wait, they serve LUNCH?! Wait, they brew BEER?! Despite the very OBVIOUS hint in their NAME, I didn't catch onto this. Because I've only ever seen people drinking 40s of Bud Light. Yeah, at night, it attracts THAT crowd.

Ya know what, sometimes I'm in the mood for that. Which is why I find myself at Morgan Street. I'm 22 years old and single. Sometimes I just wanna drink and dance and people watch and maybe catch the eye of a hot guy. Damn it, so sue me. We early 20s-year-olds are very basic creatures with very basic needs.

I like the diversity of the place. More sports bar downstairs, more pool hall upstairs, nice patio, and then across from that, a nightclub. It acknowledges all my multiple personalities! So whatever you're in the mood for, even if it changes from one minute to the next, you will be taken care of here. I love it for that reason..

I hate it for the drink prices. $7 for a house vodka and Sprite? Kiss my ass! And I hate it for the meat market it truly is. But hey, I guess I did ask for it.

But seriously, the amount of guys that circle around on the dance floor and stare LITERALLY with their tongues hanging out kind of makes me want to vomit. And please, gentlemen, don't use your ""You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals"" method of coming up behind me and attaching yourself to my ass.

However, I happened to be in need of a few specific items, and usually I can find said items at the Canseco's on Esplanade, so since this was the first grocery store I saw after deciding to acquire abovementioned items, I stopped in to buy them. 

However, after spending several minutes failing to find: whole wheat lasagne noodles, ricotta cheese, a disposable lasagne pan, the kind of litter I usually buy, cat food, a massive bag of mozzarella cheese, fresh green beans, and other stuff, I finally got frustrated, gave up, and bought the one thing I did manage to find (cans of fancy feast). 

Lesson learned. This place carries none of the things I usually buy, so there's no reason to ever go here again, unless I for some reason decide to move to...Gentilly? What neighborhood is this in? 

So, there you have it. It's not a bad place in itself, it's a grocery store in a place where a grocery store is, I imagine, sorely needed. However, it's inconvenient to my house, I like the Canseco's on Esplanade better, and the one time I tried to buy stuff they pretty much failed me on all counts. 

And thus ends part one of Jessica's Epic Grocery Store Adventure. Keep an eye out for future chapters in this overly detailed story of my attempt to buy cat food and the ingredients to make lasagne. (It involves another six grocery stores, approximately.)

Paid 100.00 to have someone come out to the house, said they couldn't transfer billing without sending a tech.

Tech told me they could ""take it over"" no problem but that  the current system could not be used on Pulse, (despite it working on Pulse up until the day he got here). We walked the property, including the guest house and we discussed the need for 4 new keypads, 3 in the main house and 1 in the guest house. The updated system quote was over $1100, included 4 new wireless / wired hybrid keypads, that included the guest house and an updated hub. Despite the online offer for 27.99 per month, that included 850.00 in equipment, tech never mentioned that offer and I'm paying 59.00 per month, no equipment included, nice!

Same guy was here for a whole day, left at around 8pm, left the old keypads on the floor where he took them off, left garbage in every area he worked, just really unprofessional, wires hanging everywhere, no wire management what soever, my 10 year old would have done a cleaner job! He left without the install complete but had me sign the 2 year contract and pay the upfront costs. 

Second visit a week later, they made sure to set the return visit to complete the system until after the mandatory recision day or I would have canceled! Three guys were here, couldn't integrate the cameras, they really didn't care if they worked or not, didn't put a wireless key pad in the guest house, didn't replace the motion detectors, no glass break sensors, no STAY or AWAY feature as there are now no motion sensors. CHIME when doors open feature doesn't work. overall experience would be rated less than 1 star if I could. The guy originally set the system to instant alarm on all the doors except the front door so if I hadn't said anything he would have had to come back to change the doors coming in from the garage, the front door gets used maybe once a month. I sent a text to the tech on last Friday when I discovered the CHIME feature wasn't working, no response, its Tuesday.

Net result, no access to the 9 cameras, no STAY and AWAY feature, no coverage on my guest house, no followup for smart home services as requested, this house in 9,000 square feet. I would have been way better off just dumping the entire ADT system and putting in a wireless system myself and using a IP based monitoring system, ADT has no clue as to who represents them, this installation group are a joke.",8,loQq9Ln145eJ7Y1Kzv9WZA

I also made the unfortunate mistake of picking Payless Car Rental in Tampa. They quoted me a good price. That quickly changed. Problems included misrepresentation of prices, lied to me to upsell services I did not request or need, unauthorized credit card charges, literally threatened to charge me whatever they wanted, and had the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They make money off of cheating customers and when confronted state this is their standard proceedures. My quoted price was for $99.28 but was charged $272.60 when I went to return the car, almost triple what I was told would be charged. Like others have said, JUST GIVE ME WHAT I RESERVED AT THE PRICE I RESERVED IT. Be honest. When I questioned the charges they were very rude. They lied and told me it was Florida law to buy their extra insurance. After doing research I found out there was no such laws. In fact most auto insurance policies cover rental cars (except loss of use). And most major credit cards also have rental coverage. Their extra insurance coverage is OPTIONAL, not MANDATORY like they told me. I demanded to talk to the manager and they closed the window and left me in the sun while they went to help other customers. No manager ever came. I wrote a complaint to their company, and the manager finally called me. He was just as rude and said they fully back their employees and their treatement of customers. The manager Phil refused to let me talk to his supervisor or even give me their name. There is no customer service department. This all sounds exagerated but is not and is an outrage. I filed a complaint with the better business bureau and Payless responded by calling me a liar. I am now disputing charges with my credit card company and am looking at further legal action against the company. I have never seen a more unethical company. They need to seriously readjust the way they do business. Please take my warning and stay away from this company. These guys CHEAT CUSTOMERS, BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE, and DISHONEST.

We did have a reservation for our Friday night dinner, and although we arrived 20 minutes early, were seated immediately.  Our server was awesome, he had recommendations, described each dish, and even offered some historical/cultural background for various menu items.

We opted to share a bunch of appetizers: Estia chips, Greek salad, grilled shrimp and grilled octopus. The chips were absolutely addicting, I wished we had two orders! The salad was a delicious cucumber/tomato salad. The grilled shrimp were excellent, just the right amount of char, and though I didn't try the octopus, my family all loved it.

For dinner I had the lagoustines which were recommended. In a pound I got 4 full lagoustines, cut and ready to eat. The meat was delicious, almost like a cross between shrimp and lobster. While the serving was one pound, you really didn't get a ton of meat, so I was happy to have had a good amount of bread and appetizers. Other members of my family absolutely loved the Dover sol and swordfish souvlaki. We shared asparagus and roasted potatoes for sides, which were both pretty plain and kind of standard.

It sits on West Trenton Avenue, where Centre Fruit used to be and next to the venerable dive Morrisville Tavern.  Don't let the neighborhood deter you, because Salute is a very good Italian shop, with dark modern tones, and interesting menu.  I stopped in for lunch today after having it on my Bookmark list for about a year.  

This is not a pizzeria by any stretch, in fact the only way you get a tomato pie is when it is offered as a special.  This place is all about a creative kitchen that spins out fresh and well considered dishes with panache. It is pricey for Morrisville, but the quality of the offerings made me forget that I was still in this struggling river town.  If they can do that, they are indeed, approaching magical.  

Lunch included a small bowl of soup, and I chose the 16 Bean alternative.  It was a solid performer, although I confess to not counting the beans. They were well cooked and soft enough to show they were simmered a long time.  The elbow macaroni in the mix contributed to the interesting textures.  I could easily imagine a soup and salad return visit. 

My eggplant parmesan sandwich became a platter upon request.  Didn't want all that bread, and my table had a large half loaf delivered up front with my water.  I was more than happy with a couple of its large sesame slices and a swipe of cool butter.  The plate was beautifully presented.  The chunky red sauce and white mozzarella covered the unbreaded thin slices of nightshade like an abstract painting framed by the square white ceramic.  Heavy silver toned utensils made short work of the cutting and lifting.  The taste was very nice, with the homemade sauce providing moral support to the veggie and cheese.  It might have been a tad salty, but not enough to detract from the pleasure of eating. 

Salute is a worthy addition to the growing (still nascent) restaurant scene in Morrisville.  I raise a glass of Sangiovese to your good fortune.",15,-G7Zkl1wIWBBmD0KRy_sCw

The cheese pizza had possibly 2 tablespoons of cheese on it.  I had to grate cheese at home and add it to it after just paying $16.

I asked them what I needed to do to reserve the truck being that I lived 6 hours away.  They said to make a $1000 deposit, pay full list price, and must be picked up tomorrow.  DEAL.

I was a cash buyer, and made them aware of it.  They talked me into applying for financing because they could give me a really good deal.  So, I made the mistake of applying, even though I was a cash buyer.....they sold me on trying their financing.

I started work the next day at 3am so I could meet their requirement of a next day pick up.  I made it, bought the truck as originally planned because they couldn't get their financing squared away within 24 hours of the application.  

My credit score was 798 at the time,  they didn't just run my credit, they ran it through 9 creditors.  NINE.  So now I have 9 hard credit inquiries which makes my credit take a BIG decrease for at least two years.

I called and expressed my concerns with their customer service department.  They assured someone would call me to help resolve this issue.  It has been 5 days now, and they have not contacted me.

DO NOT attempt to finance from these guys.  They will do much more harm than good.

First of all, I've pretty much never shopped at a farmer's market before (yes, I'm a failure as a White Person, I know, forgive me) so although I do approve of them, I don't have a ton of direct experience with other examples to compare this one with. Which is to say, I ain't no expert on farmer's markets, so proceed with caution. 

Secondly, I LOATHE grocery shopping, and have literally not gone to the grocery store since I moved into my new apartment (in October). Instead, I have managed to subsist upon ""groceries"" made ad-hoc and at 2 a.m. with stuff they sell at the Original Ghetto Mart (see my review for the Ideal Discount #4 Market - http://www.yelp.com/biz/ideal-discount-4-market-new-orleans#hrid:3cM3Q6GYa2x3NVimE77Bmg) and Newly Discovered Neighborhood Ghetto Mart (the ""discount"" ""convenience"" store that is happily located within a 2-3 minute walk of my front door, which I did *not* Yelp because then you would know where I live. And you might be a crazy stalker. No offense.) 

Now that I've decided slices of American Cheese with bread does not constitute a sandwich, and I probably cannot survive for much longer on Coconut M&Ms, VitaminWater and booze, it's become increasingly apparent that I need to go to the f*ing grocery store, or sign up for one of those services that sends you meals and/or groceries, because food is something I remember fondly and would like to reincorporate into my life. It's getting old, and surely there's a service out there that can help with this. Right? 

Given my current nutritional intake, I was SO EXCITED when I unexpectedly happened upon the Mid-City Green Market yesterday AND they weren't closing up AND I had cash on me AND therefore I could have real, actual, wholesome, non-plastic cheese and other food! Oh, and bonus, it's totally Satsuma Season! I heart satsumas, and am always sad when the season ends. Thus, my first purchase was a $4 small bag of satsumas. As I continued down the very short aisle of stalls, I bought a loaf of crusty multigrain bread, a one lb. box of Pontchatoula Strawberries, a $1 pint of fresh local milk, and eventually couldn't carry any more stuff. (Did I mention I was on foot?) 

Long story short: I heart this tiny, adorable farmer's market because they magically appeared one day, right after I'd been complaining about what a failure of a grownup I am when it comes to feeding myself properly. Thank you, universe!",6,GJv1yf_IhUZqpDjFr86DmA

At the recommendation of one of my friends, we started our journey at The Original Tony Lukes. While I know we encountered multiple locals having their arguments about the best local spot, my friend who moved here about a year and a half ago stated that this one was his go to spot.

We enjoyed a greasy cheesesteak, topped to sharp provolone and added some mushrooms and grilled onions. The flavor of this cheesesteak was incredible, and the meat quality was solid as well. I personally appreciated that the slices of meat were thin, but flavorful, and paired with the sharp provolone this was great. However, this was quite a messy meal and we ended up with grease all over our hands after completing the meal.

Overall, this was an incredibly flavorful cheesesteak that we really enjoyed. We appreciated the long hours they were open, as we stopped by fairly late and got to enjoy a nice cheesesteak. Even at 11 PM, they had a line formed of people waiting to order. Definitely worth checking out!",3,XZxVtNZo-2RCVbUr_a8XPw

One of the coolest parts about coming here is you can just feel the energy in here from the past which is kinda a kick in the face to the current times as I feel our government is in shambles even more so with the election as none of the candidates are worthy because I feel they need to step back into this room and start over again just like they did back in the day!

My friend had the salmon. Flavor was amazing, however, within the hour she started throwing up. Definite food poisoning. Didn't bode well for the concert we were going to. This is the second time I have eaten here. The first time the bruschetta was excellent, but the bacon Brussels sprouts were over cooked, insides mushy and outside charred.

If you're like me and love Asian food - you might be shocked to learn the struggles these communities are currently facing. 

We've seen almost 3000 Asian hate incidents this past year and the number keeps rising. From physical assaults, to verbal harassment to civil rights violations across 47 states in America.

We need to speak up, show our support and raise more awareness.

It's time for us to remember the impact these communities have made in our lives. 

All we need to do, is love the Asian community the way we love their food.

I stopped in this past Saturday for lunch with my good friend who happens to be a culinary chef.  We both started off with a nice cold IPA.  After some browsing of the self-described ""American style grill, focusing on Northwest cuisine..."" menu, I decided on the Cubano sandwich and my friend went with their Pastrami Burger.  

The food and the presentation was very impressive and satisfying.  The Cubano had a bit of a smoke flavor to it which was an interesting twist.  

My friend was absolutely floored by his selection and did not leave a single crumb behind.  

This place isn't huge, but it doesn't need to be.  It's just right!

Concept: Another Bongo Java baby has been birthed...(pause for dramatic effect) right next to their already successful Fido establishment. If not immediately obvious, they serve hot stuff and they serve cold stuff. 
Slightly not as obvious concept: you can enjoy hot stuff paired with cold stuff. 
Fine print about the slightly not as obvious concept: you can only enjoy hot stuff paired with cold stuff if you want your wallet to be a little lighter.

Now, onto the ""stuff"" offered. As to the hot stuff, they offer both tea, coffee, espresso, and chocolate.  The teas are great, I would definitely recommend them and the coffee is Bongo Java. As I have mentioned in previous reviews, I am not a huge fan of Bongo Java coffee but I tend not to dislike it as much in specialty espresso drinks because espresso has a different flavor and it's been mixed with other delicious things. For the cold stuff, they offer scrumptious Jeni's ice cream--the only other place outside of Ohio to offer this amazing ice cream made from the milk of grass-fed cows. The flavors are amazing: I love the Bourbon Butter Pecan--it's creamy, slightly sweet, and you can definitely taste the Bourbon (almost so much that I wonder why they don't ask for an ID).  The ice cream selection varies day-to-day and they have some exotic flavors. But, the portions for the price are pretty small. Meant to be savored, not to make you feel satisfied after a light dinner. They also offer Las Paletas, local handmade Mexican popsicles with also an assortment of awesome flavors. 

What bothers me the most about this place, however, is the atmosphere. It is extremely small and there is only a single row of tables on the right side of the venue where the line forms. For the price you pay for some of their offerings, I would have expected at least a comfortable place to sit! Service is great, however. All of the workers that I have encountered have been overly nice, welcoming, and willing to explain their offerings and give samples of the delicious ice cream.",3,DB4rJbDorOPa19lwIFhTgw

I eat when I'm sad what can I say.

I ordered the chicken sandwich with the soup of the day and quinoa salad. He ordered water.

I sat there, crying as he stone faced handed me paper after paper to sign. I never wanted this. He did.

The waitress 100% saw what was happening and I know that's why she distanced herself from our table during the meal. She was there when she was supposed to be but didn't linger, quick to the point and then gone. It was actually perfectly handled for the situation. 

She took my food to box up for me. Yet, it was when she brought it back that I thought...maybe she was trying to connect with me in another way. What she wrote on my to-go box... was just so perfect. 

So to the waitress who took my order that day, I want to say thank you. Maybe you write on everyone's boxes and maybe you don't. Maybe it was just for me... but what you chose to write really meant something to me that day.

I've been a server, and am empathetic to the job, but an explanation and an apology and better service for the rest of the meal would've done wonders.

What's so good:

They've kept the best of the old Nugget (Rosie's, Oyster Bar) but improved those areas lacking (old steakhouse has been replaced with Anthony's which is great and casino floor is a lot cleaner);

The rooms are much better - are they perfect? Maybe not perfect but perfectly comfortable. I agree the Peppermill and Grand Sierra have some better rooms (Tuscany Tower at Peppermill, yes, better but Peppermill Tower, no, not really).

Pricing is for locals which is nice. Most the restaurants and bars and much better priced than other casinos (for example a burger at the Peppermill coffee shop is tourist priced at $16 where the same burger at their locals sister property the Western Village is $11). Food is good too - I've enjoyed all my meals.

Friendly staff. They really have pushed courtesy and friendliness over the last two years and it shows in the experience.

Yes there are some issues - showers drain slowly and check-in can sometimes take a while but I do feel Marnell (the new owners) are navigating this property in the right direction.",0,tgUBF0MUfpZpfPjPJVtErw

I'd prefer a soda fountain to canned/bottled beverages but that may be cost/space prohibitive.
I bumped it up to 4 stars because my negatives are quite personal while the positives (clean, great service, fair prices, properly cooked food) are quite general.

Our party of 4 decided to go ahead and take the early dinner time of 3:45. We were seated at a very comfortable table and attended to quickly with waters. BTW the booths looked like they were comfortably, too. Our waiter, Guy, was GREAT. Turns out he is from the same area as one of our party and things got even more fun at that point! Great personality and an excellent waiter. LandOcean has a great variety of meat or seafood dishes and we covered the menu gambit with our orders. We started with the calamari that had a light batter and was no greasy; cooked perfectly! And the sauce gave just the right amount of spice and creaminess. We also had the grilled artichoke appetizer with a very delicious basil garlic aoili that I probabl would have eaten with a spoon if I wasn't with another couple. The teriyaki stir fry had a slight sweetness to the sauce at first and then a nice kick followed. The vegetables were done perfectly, still had a firmness, exactly how they should be. My husband had the french dip and it was juicy and seasoned perfectly. The bun was soft and buttery and sopped up the au jus to a T. The sea bass had a beautiful crust but was easily cut with a fork placed on a nice bed of rice that my friend almost inhaled it was so good. My choice was the seared Ahi tuna and it was cooked to perfection, nice sear on all sides and just warm in the middle as it should be. It came on a bed of sauteed spinach (the hint of lemon was a perfect addition) on black rice. Portion was huge but I took one for the team and finished all of it! I would definitely order it again. Dessert menu is short but hits the spot for most people. We opted for the Chocolate Lava cake with Heath Bar shards and caramel and chocolate sauce drizzle all topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream that was the perfect touch to end the meal.

Other yelpers gave me a lead that this place would be wonderful for creative salsas. But alas, for me, not at all except for one. Some  commercial raspberry jam mixed with chipotle powder was good tasting but not remarkable. The other salsas were blended liquids. They leaned heavily towards vinegar taste as a dominating flavor.

The chips were delicious and different and served piping hot. Best part of the experience.

The place is really funky, kind of dirty. The wooden benches are very flimsy - be careful. It is a tiny spot of place near the Univ. From the front patio you can enjoy the fumes of the passing traffic.

It was not busy but it took a long time to place an order. I ordered 2 Happy Hour tacos and a margarita. The tacos took forever to show up. Seriously it was not busy. The tacos were tiny and super plain and the meat was super dry. I would have loved the salsa bar at BK's to try to salvage the meal.

The margarita was in a beer glass with no salt around the rim. It was so sour and tart that I think it could peel the paint off your car. I asked to get it sweetened but that did little if any good.

We visited in July 2014 for 4 days following our wedding for a quick mini-moon as our real honeymoon wasn't until August.

The Good:
- hotel and grounds were beautiful 
- knowing that it was our mini-moon they surprised us with champagne and chocolate covered strawberries in our room, it's the little things that go a long way for me
- staff was friendly and helpful 
- we attended the mixology class which I recommend. They have some amazing cocktails
- wine tasting room was very nice. Wine was good we bought a couple bottles. Service was good
- Miro restaraunt- food was great and service was excellent

So the trip started off perfect!! 

Now for the bad:
- We went to dinner at the Bistro our last night there. When we sat down we asked to move closer to the patio which wasn't a problem it wasn't very busy yet. More people started coming in and it went downhill from there. We ordered cocktails an appetizer and dinner. It was obvious they were understaffed because after ordering our waitress hardly came to our table. We did see her running around from table to table so it wasn't her fault. Just after ordering I realized I left my purse at the first table. I went back it wasn't there so I went to go find our waitress because who knows when she would have came over to the table. She said she would ask right away. Time went by and nothing. I see her walking around helping people. She finally came back totally forgot about the purse so I asked her again, of course the whole time I couldn't enjoy myself because I was worried about it. She said oh ya I asked some of the staff I'll go check. Well then I saw her walk up to the front hostess and it was there the whole time. Then we got our drinks. Well part way through my husband felt something in his mouth, it was a small shard of glass!!!! So we waited waited finally grabbed another waitress showed her and she apologized. Eventually our waitress came by for last time and apologized. He didn't get his new drink until we were already finished with our meal. We would have just cancelled it at that point if someone were to ever come around. Service was horrible!! For the price of the hotel and dining I expect a lot more.
- The morning we were leaving we went to the coffee shop. It was busy but not any busier than any Starbucks. They had a staff of three. We ordered coffees and two breakfast sandwiches. After we ordered one of the girls told us they ran out and so I ordered a yogurt and he ordered a different sandwich. We waited patiently and noticed other people after us that had to reorder were getting their food the same thing he re-ordered. I finally got up asked the girl what happened to our food. She said it's because she didn't have what we originally ordered. So I explained we gave her our new order same as the other people that re-ordered and they got theirs already. She looked came back apologized said sorry I gave them yours and didn't make another. She asked if we wanted our money back. No I didn't care about the money!!! Finally we got our food and left. 
- We called the front desk to inform them of our experiences. We didn't ask for anything we just wanted them to be informed of the poor service. They apologized and said they were going to credit us something. Well of course that never happened.

We had hoped to return but the 2nd part of our stay has us second guessing that.",2,WQZw-0B9WWKAIPogzhXTuw

Phone ettiquete: City pizza was very cordial, took the time to explain why it takes 30 minutes for the pizza to be ready - so that all the flavors in the supreme can have time to meld together. Could barely understand the guy at Oogies. Not sure if their version of supreme was broccoli and ricotta on white pizza, or there was just utter confusion.

Cheese pizza: Both were great but City had a better flavor profile, as in it was what we all imagined a good cheese pizza should taste like. Oogies had more maillard effect (browned edges), maybe they have a hotter oven, so they get points for visual appeal. City won unanimously.

Supreme: City had sausage, pepperoni, bacon, and all the veggies. It was such a great tasting pizza that even our resident Oogies fan admitted it was the better pizza. The Oogies supreme/broccolli was delightful. This was very artisan and gourmet like, the flavor combination was amazing. Again, the maillard effect- it was perfect on the ricotta. 4 out of 5 loved the garlicky finish, one guy hated it. City pizza won this too, even though they were two different pies.

I didn't see how it could possibly live up to the hype, especially in a sandwich loving city like Philadelphia.  I figured I'd give it a try, see what the hype was about

I popped in for lunch the other day, not really sure what to expect.  I ordered a pork sandwich, and an order of summer rolls.  The summer rolls might actually be too big, they are closer to a wrap in size then to the rolls I've had elsewhere.  At that size, it kind of takes away from the flavor though, the recipe doesn't scale well and too much is going on.  You end up with a lot of vermicelli and not too much other filling

The sandwich was very good, and an interesting departure from what I'm used to.  Normally I don't like jalapeños, but here they seemed to be sliced fresh, and actually contributed flavor rather than the tasteless heat you usually get with preserved peppers.  The meat was pretty good, and the roll was perfect.

Later in the week, I got a barbecue pork banh mi, which I thought was better than the first.  One thing that impressed me was how quickly they made the sandwich.  I've spent longer in a store picking up takeout.  I went back again today, and had the pork roll & pate sandwich, which wasn't as good as the others I've had.  

I also tried the bubble tea today, and while it wasn't the best I've had, it was up there.   It's something that can be a bit of an acquired taste/texture, but I've come to enjoy it.  Inside the store, they do have tables if you want to sit, but I live around the corner so I've just been getting it to go.

All in all, O sandwiches is a great option for a cheap meal, that manages to stand out in a neighbourhood with many options for  a quick lunch.  Banh mi is also a nice departure from the usual sandwich choices, and much lighter than your average hoagie.",8,dioXbYFdMCyE7zCK90eM3Q

I'll gladly travel from Anywhere to see him!  I've been treated with Botox for migraines for 20 years, and I was sooo hesitant about having to find a replacement for this quarterly treatment.  Dr Dilio is Perfect!!!  He treated me like I knew what I was talking about and didn't talk down to me as if I had no sense.  As an educated patient (with multiple post grad degrees) he seemed to acknowledge that I know more about my body, symptoms, and medications than a new (to me) physician ever could.  His questions and responses to my questions hit the nail on the head consistently.  It was clear he had reviewed my file and understood my issues.  He also is thoroughly up to date on new and advanced meds and therapies and attends conferences to be able to offer the best treatment options.  There is no way I could find anyone anywhere (sorry Don!) that's a better fit for treatment of the migraines I have had for more than 52 years.  Young enough to stay with as a patient until I'm no longer around, but clearly up to date.  If I could, I'd give him a 10 on a scale of 1-5.  I look forward to a long and satisfactory professional relationship for a very long time.  Only thing I was just a bit disappointed about was his policy  of not writing prescriptions for the heavy duty pain meds I'm used to, but I'll look for my internist and pain management specialist to assess those issues.  However he explained from the get go that non prescription of opiates was not something he does, and I was free to leave at the outset if I wasn't comfortable with that policy. 
Dr Delio is fabulous and couldn't be more perfect for me!  Highly recommend Dr Delio but I won't be upset if you don't call on him - I wouldn't want his practice to become so full he can't address patient's needs as he so competently and patiently does!!",1,93AHZuzUV9fCvALRxGEFtA

Of the three spaces each had their own personality and decorum, which made the restaurant feel bigger than it is. We had a party of six, and the restaurant printed menus saying happy birthday, which is always a nice personalized touch. As the name implies, the menu revolves around seafood, but they had a few options that could be vegetarian/vegan options. Everyone at the table ordered something different but we all sampled each other's food. Everything I tried was amazing . From the appetizers I tried the crab cake with the corn salsa and sauce,  and the calamari. Calamari was normal calamari but the jumbo crab cake was fresh and flavorful, and pairing it with the corn added a different texture profile to the dish. We loved loved loved the lobster fries, and anything with chimichurri is automatic win for me. There wasn't a ton of lobster in the fries but personally it was enough for me.  A friend ordered the lobster roll, and that was probably the most lackluster dish at the table. For my entree I had the stuffed salmon with sweet potato mash, which gave me everything i needed in one bite! It was a nice balance of savory and sweet. The spinach and cheese stuffing for the salmon was seasoned sooooo well, it really added to the salmon, and probably made the dish.

Which was wrong upon further inspection I found out that the carb was built up with guck and rust and had bad seals and I needed to rebuild it which wasn't hard but I paid $11,000 for that car and they sold it with a dirty carb and a lack of knowledge on how to even operate the car they also used cardboard to make a new heater duct for the car when a whole new one cost only $50 I don't know what other corners they cut but I'm trying to find them all so my car runs right and is correct to how the manufacturer had it.

But yeah, it's all relatively delicious and not something you could eat every day unless you aspire to look like those morbidly obese people riding around in the handicap scooters at Wal-Mart. Prices are kinda steep but at least it's fresh.

We lived in three different units starting at a one bedroom and as leases expired we moved to a 2 bedroom, then 2 bedroom with a den. We paid our rent religiously on time and all was well. We never had any cleaning issues or fees raised concerning our security deposits as that we always scrubbed our apartments clean when we moved out. 

Last month we finally decided to buy a house (when our lease expired) and unfortunately for us this is also when Viera was set to retire and new manager Jennie started. 

Our last day at the apartment was also Viera's last day. We scrubbed our apartment including disassembling the refrigerator and cleaning all floors, toilets etc. Viera actually showed our apartment on this day and said I didnt need to go that far because our lease spelled out that they would re-clean the unit. We turned in our keys and thought all was well.

Less than a week later I called the apartment and spoke to Jennie the new manager who said they were processing my security deposit and that $1030 was due back. At no time did she mention anything about there being any issues with the unit and again we had been out a week. Jennie had agreed to give us our security deposit on that Monday if we stopped by the complex as that we needed it for an unexpected emergency at our new house (furnace went out).

Monday came around and I tried to call the apartment and nobody (including the answering service) answered which was unusual. I called back about an hour or so later with the same results. Shortly afterwards I got a rather nasty email from Jennie saying that they had 30 days to give me my deposit back and she didnt have time to go to the bank; it was obvious that she had been ignoring my calls. 

The following Thursday I called back and was told by the Jennies new assistant (who is very nice) that the check would be available Friday (I said I'd pick it up Saturday). I asked to speak to Jennie and asked her about ignoring my calls and she said she was in meetings in the office and couldn't answer the phone. Jennie still mentioned nothing wrong with the deposit and as far as I knew from her words alone I was due to get back $1030.

Sensing how unpleasant she was in general I called back to ask how much we were getting back and was told that a $200 cleaning fee had been charged because of brown staining on some of the tub caulk and some grease on the cabinets. I had scrubbed each and was aware that there was some very minor staining but again this was very usual wear and tear; Jennie wouldn't budge and said I could pick up the check Saturday.

As stated before we had a great relationship with the previous management and always allowed them to use our apartment for the required yearly fire inspections etc. Viera was a warm and wonderful manager. Jennie on the otherhand is simply nasty and uncaring. I went to great lengths to scrub this unit and was charged for minor brown stains on grout that should have easily been covered as normal. I was never notified of these charges until I asked and would have had plenty of time to address them as that we actually vacated 3 days before our lease was up. tenants and potential tenants beware.",9,DeA1tmIi-TidvBFPEsR-Cg

He was staying at Manor Care before transferring here and it was peaceful there.  2 weeks at Rosewood and he was out.  There are some very caring nurses here but some very ghetto staff who do not care about the residents.  My dad was left at the nurses station in a wheelchair from sun up till sun down.  I had witnessed it 3 times in one week.  This is cruelty.  I also saw a couple of nurses make fun of another resident in the hallway and I snapped at them.  Another nurse had them reported, and apologized to me for their lack of professionalism.  I had to deal with attitudes from nurses who were annoyed by my dad's behavior.  Leaving residents sitting at the nurses station lost in space felt more like a repremand.  As a guest I picked up that much.  I also witnessed another male staff member shout out the word bitch across the hall when one of the residents set off their alarm on the bed.  Some of the staff laughed.  Please do not leave your loved ones here.  I even saw my dads personal therapy nurse slam him on his bed and he cried out in pain.  And she asked him immediately what was wrong.  But i read right through her bs because being his personal therapy nurse she would be especially notified and aware of any specific pain he was going suffering from.  My instincts tell me he was taken out early because of the rigid procedures of this establishment.  To any of the workers who may read this review, some of you do not belong in this line of work.  This is the last walk for many souls here before they depart.  They should be guided with dignity and with people who truly care.  I think upper administration needs to take a closer look at what goes on day to day.  It's all a matter of whether they care enough to do so.  So many residents have to wait way to long for assistance.  For medications and simple things.  A resident shouldn't have to wait over an hour to have to be tended too.  Especially for pain medicine.  The upper administration should take a field trip to Manor care and evaluate how they take care of their tenants.  Take some notes for the sake of your residents and their families.  After 2 weeks worth of visits I feel the administration should be completely ashamed of themselves for these failures.

Small restaurant, always packed. They do take reservations, which I highly suggest. There is indoor and outdoor seating, which I like. I love the indoor herb display. There is only 1 male and 1 female stall so that's a bit of inconvenience. 

Brunch does offer unlimited mimosas with several flavors to try (apple, cranberry, orange, pineapple). The food itself is very tasty; i particularly enjoyed their Parmesan fries and their spin on chicken and waffles (which is Asian inspired so completely different from the usual).

Why not 5 stars? The parking. You can opt for valet but there is such limited parking otherwise and it is particularly annoying as the restaurant is on a one way street so you can find yourself circling the whole block. Additionally, even though we had reservations and arrived on time, we still had to wait 20mins to be seated.",3,9SlcwQAgtVBdESfwbIsG2A

Today we reunioned to celebrate a coworker, and nothing has changed at Lester's. We were in the bar.

Fabulous service. Fabulous food.

We had the chicken tenders, which are so huge they must be AT LEAST cut in half for sharing. Great ranch (?) sauce. What allows these to be so tender and moist is THAT they're big.

I've done chicken tenders at home from what I've bought at the grocery store. And they're so slim and thin, there's no way they'll be moist. Lester's has got a special butcher to provide its tenders.

Wonderful taste. Wonderful moistness. Great dipping sauce. And the breading was spectacular.

We also had the spinach-artichoke dip served with tortilla chips. OK. One can say this is a ho-hum appetizer. You might count me in on that.

But THIS spinach-artichoke dip was not like anything I've had elsewhere. Thick, creamy luxurious full of spinach and artichoke (Does this qualify as a vegetable?) with chips that stood up to the dip.

OK. Meal done. Not in the healthiest way, perhaps. But certainly in the tastiest way.

Our servers were fabulous. Always watching for refills. And most attentive on separating checks.

Overall, there were 13 of us in this group sitting at a table of 8. But people came, and people went, and it all worked. And we pulled a few chairs over . . . that worked.

Thank you, Lester's, for this great celebration!

But as I stood in the louisiana heat in a relatively short line for longer and longer (it was probably about 75 minutes before I was seated), I couldn't help wondering if it was worth all the hype.

Well, my answer is: sorta. The food itself is actually very good. The potato salad was flavorful and a little spicy. The fried chicken is the real deal. Very juicy and delicious. I can see how the argument could be made that it is among the best around. But with that said, I just don't think it was good enough to justify an hour and change of intense direct sunlight.

Now here's why I more than likely will not be back. First, it is terribly disorganized. We were served food without napkins and silverware. I ordered cornbread muffins that never came. Second, they were out of every side on the menu except potato salad by the time we were seated. They were also out of tea and lemonade. Finally, despite these shortcomings, there was a general ""if you don't like it 10 other tourists from Ohio or New Jersey will be happy to take your place"" attitude that permeated this place.

I went because it is an iconic place. My review probably won't stop you from going, but be warned that you will probably walk out saying, ""the food was good, but not worth the trouble.""",4,gK9q-OTSYdllXTkZ2NIQfA

I requested that they remove the wire, remove the rails, obtain enough wire to completely enclose the area, then put the rails back up. the owner stated he is refusing to remove the rails to rehang the wire. the owner's offers of correcting the fence involve cobbling, and patching things so the fence will be appear as though an amateur put it up, which is unacceptable. the people in charge are very rude and unprofessional. i figured out how to post pictures of some of their fine work.",8,jwtirYGneIL-ZbeANTwiOw

HORRIBLE.  I asked the server to take it away as it was inedible. 
Our entrees arrived.  My wife's meal was cold and the cheese-steaks that my son and I ordered were burned to hell.  My wife got her meal re-fired while my son and I were too hungry at this point to wait.  Too add, my son sat there without a beverage the whole meal because we were never attended to.

The brought me a wrap with beans inside and when I asked to have a _new_ without beans and tomato they clearly took the same one and had the beans removed as I found small bean traces and pieces the second time. When I asked again for another one the manager came clearly annoyed at me. In the third order they brought me the wrap but (for cost efficiency?) they didn't add any sour cream and the chicken was overly bland and watery from a fresh boil. A very obvious rushed order. I addressed the issue and the manager came to me and told me and I quote that 'normally this is not an order they should have accepted as the wrap comes only with beans and tomato and that's the recipe'. I was _forced_ to a refund, without the tip which stayed at the restaurant, and an obviously fake apology and their hope that next time things will go better and they pretty much asked me to leave. I entered the restaurant and 20 minutes later I left without any food and a tip worth of money less.

Gold standard really used to be a gem in the neighborhood food scene but with management changes things have changed a lot. And this is reflected both in food quality and in service. Friends like this place for convenience so I've been there a couple of times more. The food is really not that good.

In the Age of Corona, there are far fewer entertaining and safe activities, and I admit, going through a car wash is kinda like dinner and a show for me, at least right now.  

So..Pete's. I decided to take the Patriarch's van through this car wash more or less on a whim, it was on my way home from picking up some medications, and so I figured what the heck. The van is covered in pollen, it could use a wash.  Pulling in is a bit odd, the lot is triangular in shape, as it' borders Conestoga and Lancaster Ave (Route 30).  It's manageable, though.  They have the automated wash, then the DIY vacuuming, and like in other establishments, they have blocked off every other vacuum bay to promote social distancing. I appreciate that. 

I pull up to the automated machine. It was very easy to select the ""Premium"" $17 wash, use my card, no problems.  Headed into the wash itself with one employee, masked, doing the point left/point right, stop directions that guided my car onto the tracks.

I have to say the show wasn't nearly as colorful as others, yeah there were some flashing lights.  The wash seemed shorter in length too, although we went through the suds, scrubs, rinse, shine and blow dry cycle.

Probably the most disappointing though was that the van just didn't seem very, well, clean, from all of it.  There was no pollen any longer, however there wasn't really a shine or gleam to the car, such that someone would say ""Wow, you got the car washed"".

Even after Katrina ravaging the city and the ""ninth ward"" still in a state of high disrepair, most of the city is getting back on its feet.

But to be frank for my palate, hitting your basic cheap Mexican place with cheap margaritas is more to my liking. This would be a nice date place. It's more upscale than your average place.   But for authenticity, great prices, fresh made chips (they've come out sizzling), and really tasty food, we have a little go to place in Princeton.

- obnoxious staff (saying ""I don't care"" to another customer when she asked about which design she liked; pointing to our feet and talking in another language the whole time which prompted another customer to ask if they were laughing at her feet)

-an over zealous staff whisked me away when I indicated I wanted a pedicure - halfway through, she mumbled something to me which I thought she was asking me whether I wanted my feet scrubbed and I said yes. Being  a first timer here, I thought the longer than normal procedure was their norm only to be slapped with a $50 bill for a 'spa' pedicure as opposed to a regular pedicure that I requested when I came in. Instead of apologizing, the owner and her were adamant I had asked for it. I paid in full partially because I was in a rush and because I should have asked her to repeat herself when she mumbled halfway through my pedicure while I was engrossed in my reading.

The only good thing about our server was that she knew correct service style and placement. 
 
The food was very good, with the whitefish carpaccio with yuzu being the favorite.  It really does melt-in-your-mouth (as did the other dishes) and I recommend eating the pea shoot accompaniment with the sauce as well.  My hamachi rolls were mostly hamachi, which is appreciated.  I love black cod, and this version, paired with a miso mustard, disappeared quickly.  It's obvious that all of the fish here is super fresh and tasty, and I would expect nothing less.

Honeycake was delicious and the vanilla ice cream rich and flavorful.  Yet, for as tasty as the food was, I remain underwhelmed.

That's not authentic Mediterranean/middle eastern food. That's like eating fries with a burger at Five Guys. The food was bland...let me say very bland.
I have eaten authentic middle eastern and mediterranean food, so the taste and flavors are not new to me. I think they need to sample some of the other middle-eastern restaurants to improve their menu and taste, even other similar restaurants in NYC or Canada.
What's good -- polite male server/host. Plenty of parking, convenient location right off rt 73. Ambiance is ok, but I don't go to a restaurant for it's decor, so that doesn't matter, as long as it looks clean, which this did. It's more like a fake middle-eastern ambiance, with tacky desert palm trees on the front windows, etc. to create the theme...again, the decor doesn't matter to me.",0,BYJCNf-ZiqtjpyG6ECGDkg

If you go in expecting the food to be perfect, you'll likely be disappointed. There's only so high the quality can be at $8.00 a pop. 

The atmosphere is very casual, and a little too dim for my taste. We were seated immediately around 12:00 PM on a Wednesday. The waitress brought our water promptly, but was a little rigid whenever we thanked her or asked her for anything. Probably just a cultural difference. Everything appeared to be clean to me, save for a few sticky spots on the table. 

There is a wide selection to be sure. My first plate included staples such as fried rice, lo mein, pepper chicken, General Tso's chicken, orange chicken, teriyaki chicken, and New York steak (because why not). The lo mein was exceptionally, and a personal favorite. The pepper chicken and teriyaki chicken were wonderfully tender and flavorful, but the orange chicken and General Tso's chicken was dry and bread-y. The New York steak was exactly what you'd expect: a cheap and fatty cut. But I won't hold that against a Chinese buffet. 

There are classic Chinese soups, and a large salad bar that looked like it contained rather fresh ingredients. There's also American food for the more picky eaters, such as macaroni and cheese and chicken fingers. 

It's worth noting that there is very little crab and shrimp available, which is to be expected. There was some salmon, however. 

There is a small sushi bar, which I wasn't impressed by. A lot of it lacked flavor, but the fact that they had sushi available at such a cheap buffet was surprising to me. There was plenty of wasabi, soy sauce, and other sauces as well. I'm picky when it comes to sushi, so hopefully more experienced eaters will enjoy it more than I did.

There is a hibachi grill, which my grandfather swears by. You can create a plate of raw vegetables and meats which you then give to them to grill with your choice of sauces. I've tried it myself, and it is very flavorful and delicious. 

The desserts are very tasty! They have sweet buns, which are delightful. Additionally, I saw puddings near the salad bar, and a large freezer full of about six hard ice cream flavors. I also sampled an apple turnover, which was very dough-y and lacked sweetness. The sweet buns made up for it though.

Overall, a very great restaurant! I will be eating at it whenever I'm in Nashville for sure. The food is delicious and quite a bargain for the selection provided.",2,EwFIzE0MbksD71NYprY9xQ

We had 4 items totaling a little over $20. He said he needed to talk to the manager. I was on hold for a bit and the manager (who from their website is actually the owner) got on the phone and with a snippy attitude said ""this is (name) how can I help you?"" He said it in a way that implied that I was the one who had a problem? I told him I wanted to place an order for delivery and he sighed and asked ""no one can pick it up?"". I said ""no"". And he said ""well I have two guys out in philly right now and it won't be for another half hour till the food gets there"". I said it was fine and I understood. He asked me how many items and if my order was over $20. I said yes and instead of letting me say my order over the phone he had me fax it. Which is fine. It makes it easier that way. I really love the food there. They have a great variety and amazing breakfast too. But I will never ever order from there again. That guy had the worst attitude. Instead of being a jerk about it, he could've just said ""hey mam I'm so sorry but we just can't right now"". I would've totally understood, but he chose to be nasty about it. I would give zero stars honestly. I don't know what I did to deserve to be treated like such a burden, but a simple no or a minimum delivery cost would've been acceptable and I would've gone else where and I wouldn't have been offended, or a minimum delivery cost and I would've ordered more. If they want to be nasty and rude like that then they should just take out the delivery option. I can't continue to stress how offended I was, but I hope no one experiences what I experienced.

Excellent appetizers got our hopes up.

A good wine list, but the bottle was opened upon arrival without so much as showing either of us the label and served, glug, glug, to the brim with no tasting. Nice touches for a $69 bottle.

Actually had 4 pieces of penne one yes one gnocchi for twenty dollars a person after waiting for 45 minutes.Than over an hour later the main course came out. All eight dinners were ice cold.We sent back more than half of the dinners.The waiter offered desert on them but that was another 30 minutes for him to come back to take that order. At this point we said don't brother. I asked to speak to the owner to make him aware of what happened. After 20 minutes of waiting for him we gave up.

For drinks, we only indulged in coffee but the cocktail menu looked fab. The espresso was Ace Coffee Roasters and was delicious (although no decaf - get on that ACR!!)

For food, we split the quinoa and kale salad and the grilled cheese. I'm very glad we shared because both were incredibly delicious, but I would have found it difficult to finish either dish on it's own as the flavours are strong. The grilled cheese is a perfectly toasted blend of cheeses that hits the spot! But, served with french fries and aioli, this meal is quite rich with nothing to offset it. Although I haven't tried them yet, I'd recommend getting the soup or salad to offer some balance to this meal (hopefully). 

The kale salad was soooo good. The menu says the dressing is green goddess, but honestly, it tasted like a *very* garlicky tzatziki sauce. Delish, but don't order before you head to an important meeting. Also the quinoa is toasted, which adds a lovely crunch, but was a bit tiring in its chewiness by the end.

I so love this place and think it's such a lovely addition to the brewery district- definitely take the time to check it out!

I had never been to this particular theater before they renovated it though, so I can't comment on the way it ""used"" to be.  Looks can be deceiving though, it looks like a SMALL theater from the front but it is not.  Very large with lots of movie options, a really nice concession area with better than average menu options.  (Think sandwiches and fries, etc) And for whatever reason we really like their popcorn better than AMC....

The bathrooms are always nice and clean and large enough to be accommodating without much of a line.  Most times not even a line.  (Marlton 8 has the smallest bathrooms ever, like 3 stalls each lol)

The employee's are generally nice, if a theater isn't ready and you sit at a table in the concession area they will come tell you when it's ready, etc... 

However at least in theater 8, I couldn't see over the railing on the top row.  lol This theater is pretty small, only two rows on the back section of the theater so even the back row is great seating.  But I'm kind of tiny.  Kid's size even.  lol  (Only 5 feet tall.)  So if I can't see over the railing, I know most kids and teens wouldn't be able to either.  It was somewhat distracting at first but once the movie started it wasn't MUCH of a problem.  Still had trouble seeing the bottom of the screen..... Another review said the seats are not good if you are too tall.  So apparently Regal only thought of ""average"" sized people when renovating this theater.  lol ( I should mention that II did NOT have this problem when sitting in the first row of the back half of the theater on a different visit.  It's just the back row.)

We love the new leather reclining seats, they don't go ALL the way back like other places but I'm ok with this.  You also can't raise the middle arm rest creating a love-seat type of effect.  Which we like to do, but not a deal breaker.  

One thing that really annoys me and this has always been a problem at ALL Regal cinema's, even before the renovations and now still after.... Is that a Large size soda does not fit in the cup holders.  lol WHY?  Why didn't anyone think of this.  AMC corrected this problem when they put in the new seats..... It's again annoying but not a deal breaker.  

All in all, we really enjoy this theater, it's in a great location and it's comfortable and an enjoyable night out.  (Also, the birthday party room is ADORABLE if you have a kids party, this would be a good option!)",1,6tWuU1X4lCdT2lEYeql7QQ

First problem, sanitation. For a brand new place, I was not expecting this. I've been here three times, and each time the guy making the sub wasn't wearing gloves, and had the bread directly on the countertop. The same countertop that is shared with the cash register and where customers sometimes place their money on. Maybe they sanitize it, but I never saw them do so. At least place the bread on wax paper or a separate, washable, plastic or wood surface!

Now for the food. I've only tried the cold subs from here. The #13 - Original Italian is my favorite. I tried a roast beef and the roast beef was best described as raw; it was bloody red, mushy, and tasted raw. I threw out 90% of that sub. They also seem to have a problem with reusing old lettuce day-to-day. The lettuce is always half brown, even at 11am in the morning. The bread is good, but on the hard side. Think of it as being toasted, then let cooled.

The value isn't great for what you get. They put TONS of lettuce on the subs - I assume to give it the appearance of being huge, and thus being able to justify their high prices. Well, since I'm not a fan of brown lettuce, I have them put very little lettuce on. A ""giant"" sub then begins to look pretty small; especially when the bread is so thin to begin with. Definitely not worth the $16-18 for a giant sub and drink.

Lastly, they are pretty pushy about their tips. The credit card terminal starts off with a whole screen dedicated to leaving a tip, and they verbally bring up the screen. Then, if you choose zero, the receipt prints out ""TIP: $0.00"" in the middle, and they have you sign it. I felt awkward, but then again, why would I tip in a place like this? It's not a restaurant with wait staff. They don't even clean the tables, which are usually oily messes.

In conclusion, I like the subs enough to keep coming here, but they only get 2 stars until they wear gloves, place subs on a separate surface like wax paper or cutting board, throw out their lettuce when it browns, and remove the tip screen from the credit card terminal.",0,b3-4bPdGdAjhuWnsebqRFg

Second, make sure to time your visit. You order, sit down, wait for your food, and drool as you watch everyone else get their food. Come a little earlier or a little later than the typical lunch hour as to not wait in line for TOO long. 

Walking in, the place has a very STRONG smell of meat, which, after my noise adjusted, was heavenly. Everything I saw on the menu looked amazing! I ordered the duck pastrami sliders -- This is listed as a small plate and it IS a small plate. Don't be disheartened by that, if you order any of the sandwiches, you will definitely need an extra stomach to eat it all.

I appreciate the hotel security. I didn't mind having to show a room key to get to the elevators. Check in was a breeze and we were even able to check in a bit earlier, from our scheduled check in time.

The room was dated and could have used a deep cleaning. The bathroom was very crammed, there wasn't much elbow room. We weren't in the room much, so all I can say was the room was functional. 

Now, let's flash forward to the next month. We had tickets to a concert at nearby Reno Events Center... this is where the decision to never go back stemmed from...

We decided to book a spa suite. We arrived to a somewhat short check in line. As the line formed, behind us, it seemed the clerks lessened or disappeared causing our wait time to check in to take a while. No biggie. 

We asked the hotel clerk at check in about accommodations to get to the concert because of a mobility impairment. She suggested we check with the bell hop - we did and he stared at us blankly and said ""we don't do that. It's only two blocks away."" Then he suggested we check with valet but we chose not to, because passing the buck seemed to be a common thread. 

Upon check in we started noticing things wrong with the room. Now, don't get me wrong - we are not neat freaks, nor are we slobs, but when you pay close to $300 for a suite, you expect to get quality for your money.

First, the fingerprints...they were EVERYWHERE on the dated black, glossy furniture. Above the spa, there was a splattering of black MOLD. Upon entering the dated bathroom, there were very distinct streaks over the glass shower door and an empty soap wrapper was laying on the shower floor. Above the shower was several strands of long hair. The dated counter tops had questionable stains throughout. While getting ready for the concert, and about to leave, there was a knock on the door and it was two housekeeping persons. We barely had a chance to answer the door before they were already unlocking and poking their heads in. This seemed weird and made me wonder if they were casing out our stuff. They asked us if everything was to our liking and my husband told them about the hand prints on the furniture and they quickly started polishing. Not wanting to be late for the show, and awkwardly leave them in our room, we didn't tell them about the other issues. 

After we arrived home, we felt the need to shower, for a second time that day. The hotel shower, just seemed dirty and the smoke from the casino seemed to cover us in a disgusting film. The following day, when I checked our checking account balance, I noticed a $20 some charge, deducted from the hotel. I called reservations, to inquire about the charge, and I was transferred to the front desk. Now, I don't know if the woman I spoke to was having a bad day, but she was very curt with her explanation of the charge - supposedly it was a resort fee, which I thought we had already paid but she insisted we had not. When I asked her for a copy of our receipt to be sent to my email, she seemed put out. She read my email that the hotel had on file to confirm and my email address was completely misspelled which would explain why I never received our original receipt. When I politely corrected her, with my email, again, she seemed put out but told me that she would re-send it - no apology, no have a nice day, nada. 

I was later emailed a survey from Silver Legacy, which linked me to Travelocity, or a similar site. There, I gave my honest opinion, of our experience, but that was several months ago and I never once got a simple ""I'm sorry."" Lack of quality and care seems to be a common thread for the Silver Legacy and I would rather spend my hard earned dime elsewhere.",2,HcKu4bq4Twg2RVKHTtjL6A

We split an appetizer--a fantastic and tasty hummus and olive spread with pita-- and a thin crust margherita pizza-- also tasty. The pita dip came out quickly, and the timing on the pizza couldn't have been better. The bill came to less than $20 bucks, and we were back on the road, satisfied.

I ordered an omelet and home fries and a fried green and tomato biscuit. The food was good but probably not my favorite breakfast I have had in the area. That being said, I think I ordered the wrong thing.

The biscuit was good but not the best I have had in the Nashville area. My favorite thing I had was actually the blueberry cupcake I had for dessert. So delicious! The service was great and our waiter was very friendly. My mom had the chicken fried steak which I tasted and it was pretty good. My husband had pancakes, eggs and ham steak and he really loved his meal. I don't think I will rush back but it was fun walking around the property and shopping in all of the little stores.",0,_PP_w-GtQxr00mBqQWap0w

I used to eat there every week and it was so stupidly good.  Then I moved away.  I go to Houston and bitch and moan that No one can do the bun as well as Pho King on Franklin back home.  So I come home and OF COURSE I want some Pho King, why thank you!  

On the phone they ask me pick up or delivery.  They now have delivery!  Yaaaay!  I don't have to risk getting arrested bringing my kid to pick up my order or call inside and wait on the sidewalk with her.  It's in the back of a bar with gaming machines, hence the problem.  So, this is very good. 

They are out of the curried shrimp bun, so I get the regular shrimp for the kids and the curried tofu bun for the adults, as well as the normally awesome limeades.  Everything was a major fail.  The noodles look the same, and the romaine lettuce.  That's where the similarities end.  Everything else...looked like it was from an entirely different kitchen.  The shrimp was fried and in a batter an inch thick, like you get at a really bad Chinese restaurant.  They didn't tell me on the phone it was fried.  It has never been battered and fried before.  I am so confused.  The tofu was a pile of shredded crap with a horrible flavor and texture.  There were almost no veggies at all, and no fried onions anymore, anywhere.  The fish sauce was very bland.  Not the delicious heaven it once was.  The limeades went in the trash with the shrimp and a good portion of the tofu.  

And all this after they said they couldn't send forks or spoons for the kids.  Gee, thanks.  What has happened over there?  So so disappointed.

And I have sent so many people over there.  What the hell must they think?",1,mWSo9fEcbsJ7w9aPmtVhkQ

I had to go downtown for some lunch time errands and thought to myself, hmm, what to eat?  Lilly's?  nah, I was already leaving downtown towards the zoo area... hmmm, hey, what about that sandwich place I read on Yelp, Metro something...  

So I vaguely remembered the location from the reviews so I drove on Santa Barbara Street and was finally able to find it.  

I ordered 1/2 the turkey and brie.  Delicious and just satisfying enough.  yum. 

I took a quick glance at the menu and realised that the BF would love this place so over the weekend we rode our bikes down Cabrillo and grabbed some sandwiches on a fine sunny Saturday. 

This time I got a 1/2 of the basil and turkey and the bf got the Di Parma. 

Basil and turkey came toasted and warm.  It was perfect. 

Di Parma came cold and it's filled with prosciutto and mozzarella and greens.  Also very yummy, but slightly too rich for my tastes.  

one 1/2 sandwich, one whole sandwich and two european fizzy beverages of our choice came out to $19.00 for lunch.  Not too bad and for once I didn't mind the price b/c these are some awesome sandwiches.

The service is super friendly.  
This reminded me of my all time fav in Santa Cruz, Zoccalli's -- but I think this place is even better!  shhhh.....

Despite stating flavored coffee on the menu (and charging extra for refills), the waitress told us she didn't have flavored coffee.

Don't get the crepes.  They're an eggy mess and the berries tasted like they'd seen better days.  Despite ordering immediately, it took a further 45 minutes to get 2 egg omelets and the crepes.  We weren't served any refills on our non-flavored coffee.  The bread was weirdly buttered too - a big dollop in the middle that had already melted by the time we opened the toast, so the middle was soggy and the outside flavorless.

When we first sat down, we figured that the wait etc is because of the growing pains of opening a new business.  We were even prepared to give them a second shot.  However the food was too lousy... we won't subject ourselves to it again!

Good brisket is moist and melts in your mouth. The Ribs were overpowered by too much sauce and the flavor of the meat was not detected. Consistency of ribs were OK.

I loved checking out all of the decor from quaint to old world to kitschy. Very warm ambiance with low lighting in the booths. They also have separate seating areas to accommodate groups or luncheons. The staff all seemed very friendly & competent. 
We ordered & were served promptly & our meal was served with a perfect flow. Drinks refilled as soon as they were low. Great service. 
They immediately give you crusty Italian  bread & herbed butter spread. 
We had the wedge salad, pasta fagioli, grappo shrimp appetizer & the chicken parmigiana & plank seared salmon. 
The wedge salad was good. It had bacon & I had it with the basalmic vinagerette, there was a choice of that or blue cheese. 
The pasta fagioli was tasty. I like grated cheese with mine. This is a restaurant that brings the grated cheese for you to ""say when "". Pet peeve of mine. I like my grated cheese left on the table to use at my own discretion but c'est la vie. 
The Grappo shrimp app was tasty. Not what I pictured reading the description. It's basically 4 large buffalo shrimp. Served with a side of blue cheese & thinly sliced carrots & celery. The buffalo sauce is tangy like a honey bbq/ buffalo sauce. It was good. I'd probably order this again. 
My chicken parm was good, not great. I was a little disappointed. It was served with a side of baked pasta, however, which was delicious ! My husband had the salmon which I ate some of , it was good. There was a sweet topping. The side of potatoes Au gratin was ok. Kinda bland. The steamed asparagus was very tasty & perfectly cooked. 
The portions were a decent size & considering we ate apps we both had leftovers.   It was a very nice lunch. We weren't blown away by anything but I would eat here again if in the area. Probably just lunch tho, it's my understanding that dinner gets quite crowded. I really wouldn't hang around if there's a long wait time. They do have a nice bar in the front.

I found this company on Yelp and I love these guys. I've been a home owner for 25 years now, always older homes with older heating and cooling units, so you know I've had plenty of issues with various systems over the years and dealt with plenty of HVAC contractors.

Originally, I contacted them a couple of years ago just to get an estimate for installing central air for my office. They came in with the best price by far and got the job. Needless to say, that worked out really well.

Since then I've had them out for all sorts of other issues on the other furnaces (I have 4 furnaces in my current home). 

These guys explain what's going on and advise how you can save money. They never treat me like an idiot, and they are always fair. If they think they got something wrong, they eat the cost and don't try to pass it off to you.

The waiter gladly had my roll re made and brought it in a to go box. I would rather have just taken the roll off my ticket (who eats leftover sushi?) but the waiter had a hard time understanding the request so I gave up. 

The menu has inventive combinations and choosing a few rolls proved difficult because everything sounded delicious. They don't skimp on ingredients or quality here. The rolls were delicious and giant. I don't think I could have finished two whole rolls. 

I will say all of that generosity and ingenuity comes with a hefty price tag. Our four rolls earned us a tab pretty close to $70. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was swanky. I would say to definitely check this place out on a treat yo self evening.",1,6Y-Rim_w_XcN9Gs9aMmYZQ

I love all the veggies & goodies that come with it too.  Aside from the wasabi my plate is always clean when I leave!  The ramen salad at the Reno store is good too but not as good as the zaru.
I also enjoyed the Pork Katsu bento!  It's making me so hungry thinking about it!  I enjoyed everything that came with it.  Authentic & delicious!

When I questioned what's so hard about taking out one vegetable and substituting another, he gave me some bs story about the meals are all prepped in advance and someone would have to manually remove the peppers. Ridiculous. The chicken basil dish I had to settle for was just a bowl of overly-salty broth with baby bock choy under thin slivers of grilled chicken.

Sticking to the delivery, I love their Prime Baggin's; however, today I ordered it with Mayo and I guess they thought that meant really slathered on mayo, which drowned out the horseradish taste. It was still good; won't dissuade me from eating there. Also love the Anasazi Chicken. Hubby tried the Baggin's Cheesesteak with ribeye, a slightly different rendition from a Philly cheesesteak, which he claims may be the best he ever had (with a twist). Their cold grinder  and the Afternooner are winners, too. Update 11/2/17: ordered the Anasazi. This time, the sandwich had 3 lemon seeds in it.

I understand that it was an honest mistake, but I left a $300 dinner hungry because all that I had was an appetizer salad and some tuna.  I had to ask for the dessert menu after declining my late plate of rice, and by that time I was so pissed off that the waitress didn't seem to give a shit about her mistake that I was just over this place.  Every single course of the tasting menu was fantastic (especially the toro tartare) except dessert (could have been my bad mood at the time too).  The Morimoto BEER was amazing!

It doesn't even smell overwhelming like a lot of other places. 

I have this huge problem with trying to find natural deodorants, but I guess my armpits are really sensitive and everything from whole foods / lush / toms of maine makes my pits raw and crack (gross. i know.). But I got the ceylon natural deodorant from here, and it works amazingly. 

I also got two soaps, the vetiver and the red clover. Which both smell absolutely amazing, and the red clover is really moisturizing. 

I can't wait until my next paycheck so I can try out their shampoo bars and lotions, and everything else imaginable.

Brisket #1 was well seasoned, salty and had a wonderful fresh garlic flavor. It was a clear variation on traditional brisket, and I went back for more the next week. I liked it. Brisket #2 was overly fatty and seemed under smoked and under seasoned. I was disappointed. I'll be back for brisket #3, hoping for that salty, garlicky brisket from my first trip.

I agree with the other reviewers that B&Cs sides are the best I've had at a BBQ joint in Nashville. Delicious grits, great french fries and corn pudding. I'd love to try more.

I also agree that the sauces leave something to be desired. I'm not exactly sure, but I think they are all too acidic. I'd rather use none that whats on offer.

The seating is just OK. The space makes for a difficult seating situation, but I would consider leaving the door between the restaurant and the enclosed patio open to make it feel more connected. It felt too much like eating take-out at the restaurant.

We had a few small claims and they got taken care of. We therefore extended our warranty for two more years. What a big mistake. Once it comes to more expensive claims, like our most recent claim for a fridge/freezer defect, nothing is covered anymore. 
My freezer wasn't cooling sufficiently, with the food starting to defrost. After waiting for a day without anybody contacting me, I called back and was told that they couldn't reach any of their technicians (this was July 3rd) and that I would have to wait until Monday of the following week, July 8, to have the problem taken care of. They suggested to call my own technician if it was an emergency and to then submit the bill for reimbursement. So I did, which was another big mistake. 
I had the technician take care of the problem, which also took two callbacks, 7hours of repair time, and almost $800 to get the problem finally fixed. Each time I had my technician talk to sensible to make sure that what ever he diagnosed was covered under the policy. There were of course items which were not covered (cleaning the condenser, recharging the freon), but other items, such as dryer filter and cooling fan were ok'd to be fixed. 
When I called the company to get the mailing address to send my bills to, I was in for another surprise. All of the sudden none of the items on my bill were covered anymore, even the parts that were approved before. I was of course outraged.

I think their trick is to make you impatient by not responding to your claim in a reasonable amount of time, so you will go ahead and call your own service, while sensible  assures you that they will cover the cost for the repair.

So, I whip out my phone and consult Yelp, and find this lovely chocolate shop. My husband and I kind of went hog wild and got a lot of different things to try. First of all, let me say that my measuring stick for all chocolates is Recchuiti in SF, which is my favorite chocolate (so far as I've found). The thing with Recchuiti is the way the chocolate is tempered. It's perfect. It starts to melt the second it hits my mouth and it is just sinful. This place, the chocolates are in a crispy shell of chocolate, it's just a different style. I don't prefer that style, but I can appreciate it. So, while the actual chocolate is not the melty perfection that I desire, it was all really good. The quality is good and the infusion of flavors is excellent. My favorite of all the bunch was the Spiced Cinnamon. It was dark, smooth, and the perfect amount of cinnamon. They have truffles, and filled chocolates (labeled bon bons), soft caramels (try the Balsamic, truly unique and wonderful!) and some Single Origin chocolates. I thought the Sichuan Pepper/Orange Truffle was also very unique and good. I liked everything I tried with the exception of the Buchette Irlandaise, but that was because it was whiskey flavored and I don't drink and it was overpowering to me, but my husband loved it. We also got some caramelized chocolate covered almonds that were very good. Highly recommend and think this is a great addition to downtown SB!!",0,4sLhuOs4K9mov0bBj7HaYg

Again...very good. And they weren't holding back on the lobster either. That lil roll was packed full of lobster meat. The wood grilled corn elote was by far my favorite dish of the night. The combination of sweet and sour with a little bit of spice. I seriously could just have that as a meal. 
For tacos, we got the caramelized cauliflower, pork carnita, and grilled shrimp. The grilled shrimp wasn't the best. It paired with arugula and lemon and it just didn't seem like a good pairing. It wasn't terrible but I would t order it again. The other tacos were very delicious though. I think this place would've really hit it home for me had it had fried plantains on the menu.

It's large (the equivalent of a couch, loveseat & chaise) with a total of 7 back cushions, 4 of those are corner/end pillows with unique shapes. The seat cushions were fine but the backs were not-especially the corners/ends. A bit of a drive but I dropped the cushions off and my husband picked them up the following day on his way home from the airport. (they will do same day-1st come 1st serve).  I was a little worried the back cushions would be too firm but they explained they use a different kind of foam for the backs which I was able to test out and its the perfect firmness-comfy but supportive. WAY better then the originals.  Fast, friendly service & these are hand cut by someone that knows what they're doing. As for cost it ranged between $63-77 per back cushion-around $500 for 7 cushions+tax.  If your fabric is in good shape I highly recommend!

There is a smokehouse where you can watch the meat being smoked, and a few little stores to peruse through.  The little general store was really cool. (remember I was there as a tourist).

The decor inside the place was so great.  Very homey and comfortable.  The food was insatiable!  Biscuits and gravy definitely lived up to my expectations.  I had the pulled pork plate with mac and cheese and candied sweet potatoes and it was AWESOME.  And the sweet tea . . oh the sweet tea.

Very clean, modern venue. Indoor is well renovated. Plenty of seating for small and large groups. Bathrooms were nice and clean. This specific location was huge with several back rooms that they can open up to more clients.

Got the clay pot fish and the salt and pepper shrimp. Good size portion for both and seasoned well. Enjoyed our meal very much even the taro dessert. But for those who do not know it takes about $5 to make a huge pot but they charge $5 for a very small palm portion. I still got it anyways cause of nostalgia.

I can't testify as to the efficacy of acupuncture treatment at this last stand in the land of the lost in the sauce hippiedom, as it is well known that no assessment of the success of acupuncture treatment can be made after only one treatment. 

And fortunately, I only accepted one treatment at this hell hole of cultists and cultism.

But I CAN testify as to how these cultists ""do business.""

If you walk in the door as a man, and I'd expect as a woman as well, you can expect to be propagandized into one of two cults - one for men or one for women, of course.

""What you need is a men's group on STEROIDS!"" Ms. Rivers, the owner and chief Propaganda Officer shouted to me!

I'm thinking, ""Steroids are bad for a body and this place is supposed to be all about health?""

I know a few things about what steroids can do to a man's body - make it impotent, grow breasts, etc. So does she want to turn me into a woman or just neuter me? 

Does she hate men who don't fit her ""profile mold?""

I'm outta here after this propaganda session, 
and as she even had the f*ucking gall to tell me that the tat on my arm which most peeps find way cool, makes me a [dark person].""

Does ""dark"" = ""bad"" to Ms. Rivers?

Makes me wonder if she hates black people, 
too.

What kind of ""health practitioner"" would comment negatively upon first meeting on someone's tattoo, unless maybe she thinks she's a psycho-therapist, a job which she is clearly not trained for nor qualified for. 

And no trained and qualified shrink would EVER have the balls or breasts to judge and/or offend a new patient in such a way, either.

Good thing she didn't see the other two tats on my back, as only a psycho in serious need of psych help would pretend to be a ""professional"" at anything as to make such comments and judgements, unless applying without prior training for a job as a parole officer who would NEVER get the job with such an addytude!

And I've met, not under arrest or inprisonment, more than a few of those P.O.'s who would spit in shame over the likes of Ms. Rivers, knowing full well the crimes against humanity that the likes of her would perpetrate if allowed to, and all the while dealing with what some would call the worst of the so-called ""worst.""

I know these people NOT because I'm anyone special, but because I know the people who live in this city, just from walking and talking the streets with those who don't pretend to be ""country"" people or suburbanites whilst pretending to be civilized city people.

What say you, hippie dippies, still in hiding, still afraid of the street lights and of your own shadows?

SHAME on you, Rivers, on  your way to nowhere, as someday, the P.O's may come calling for you!

I could go on and on about the ensuing abuse that I incurred all through the  Labor Day weekend, with at least one of Ms. Rivers' cult cohorts lucky to not have been arrested for Stalking and Harassment, But I'll spare you the rest of the gory details of what I was subjected to except for this:

Ms. Rivers agreed in writing that she owed me a refund for a certain portion of what I had paid her.

However, when her mailing arrived, with me expecting to find a check inside the envelope, there was nothing but more cult propaganda sent, and with no check to be found.

Fortunately, I had paid by CC, and the CC bank has taken care of the matter on my behalf.

If I had paid in cash or by check, I'd be SOL now.

It's also worth noting that Ms. Rivers is also an attorney, and knowing full well that most people in this country don't trust attorneys and for good reasons, she uses two 
different names for her two fork-tongued ""professions.""

Trust an attorney, trust an acupuncturist? We're all screwed if we wind up with both in the same package.

Again, BEWARE, and PAY ONLY WITH CC if you can't resist this black hole in space and time!!!

Or better yet, just avoid this place like the plague - it's far from being the only game in town if you're looking for skillful and HONEST acupuncture care.

Believe, the honest acupuncturists without ""lawyerly"" cult agendas are not hard to be found in this town.

Just ask me, lucky to no longer live in a one horse cult cow ancient hip dip town.

Sometimes one hand washes the other, but all too often, one hand dirties the other with greased palms.

Such is the story of CAMA and it's cult junk junked out cohorts.

UPDATE! - as to ASSAULTS upon me since I wrote this review last night:

http://www.registertheiwla.com/reg-4/?utm_source=102264

http://mankindproject.org/new-warrior-training-adventure

These cult money mongers don't even care what kind of heart and/or genitalia you might have anymore.

They just want your munny hunny to feed their desperado Ponzi schemes!

Again, I say BEWARE of these grave diggers and their cohorts, and watch your wallet.

Lawyers and used car sales""men"" only know how to steal!

BEWARE, BEWARE, BEWARE... and keep your wallet close!

You can buy loose leaf tea, enjoy it hot or iced and take it to go or enjoy it in the tea cafe. They also have a small limited menu of wraps and sandwiches. 

I have had their duke of Africa tea, their haiku peach, tropical turmeric and I have purchased their 4 tea seasonal sampler pack which is an awesome idea! He sampler pack is $10 and the loose leaf teas on each of the 4 packs would easily make 4-6 cups of tea.

My favs are the dike of Africa, which is similar ro earl grey and the tropical tim Eric which is a great way to add turmeric in your daily diet. 
Reggie also has tea accessories for purchase as well as teatopia ""swag"" so you can represent this cute shop on Cherokee when you are out and about!

It's worth mentioning that they also had a veggie dog option, which i was going to do.  The guy at the counter couldn't vouch for it, ""I've never had it, I'm a meat-eater."", so the beef dog it was.

The dog was great and I'd def go back to try others.  THe bun was a little overwhelming and they could had cut it deeper so the dog and toppings weren't precariously balancing on top.  The toppings were plentiful.

The fries were a bit of a gap.  They were a bit like 5 Guys, but a little greasier, with less salt.  GOod, but great fries would have made this a 6-star visit.

My husband & I did the Couple's Retreat (bath & couple's massage) here & our massage was great!  Very relaxing, just the right amount of pressure.  Our masseuses were top notch, as were the ladies at the front desk (more on that in a minute).  Unfortunately, the Spa's atmosphere could be better, owing to things both within & beyond Saddlebrook's control.

Like most spas, the locker rooms/wet area/relaxation areas are gender segregated, so I can only comment on the women's.  Unfortunately, the only dry area to relax within the women's area is at a few chairs & a small table amidst the small locker room.  This area also houses the entry from the lobby to the women's area, so it's pretty high traffic on a busy weekend day & not exactly soothing.  A photo on Saddlebrook's website shows a woman in a robe lounging by an outdoor fountain.  Unfortunately, that fountain is adjacent to the spa entrance, so one would have to traipse through the Spa's lobby & out the front door in a robe to enjoy that area that is also undoubtedly high traffic, as it is off a common walkway of the Resort.  Thus, an update & expansion or reconfiguration of the Spa's facilities is needed.

The wet area that houses the hot tub & steam room has some lounge chairs, which would be a decent place to relax if the women in that area would be quiet.  Admittedly, I was there on a weekend day & I believe I was dealing with a bachelorette party, but the female urge to chatter loudly & incessantly in what should be a tranquil environment never ceases to confuse & annoy me.  Have your party at a bar, if you want to flap your gums!  Sadly, the steam room provided no respite, as the wet area lounge chairs are just under the steam room windows, so I could still hear the squawking inside the steam room.  I realize Saddlebrook has no control over their guests' behavior, but a firm quiet policy is warranted.

I inquired about such a policy to our masseuses &, though they unfortunately didn't boot out the offending parties, they were highly apologetic.  In fact, upon check out, because I requested eucalyptus scent from my masseuse, the ladies at the front desk gave me $60 worth of Saddlebrook's eucalyptus products to make up for the noise.  I really appreciated such attention to customer service, which is why I give this Spa 3 stars instead of 2.  It's also why I recently returned just to replenish my stock of their wonderful eucalyptus lotion & bath gel & why I would return for a treatment, but on a quieter weekday.",3,HNr0m1DlznSOTyKE_hnRpQ

The cheese curds were really great and we all loved them. The Menu was a bit esoteric, in that the range of global cuisine was fairly impressive for an American restaurant. 

We ordered our food but were very quickly disappointed- food was mediocre at best- cesar salad wasn't local or fresh, the chicken was left off the salad and brought to us later by a cook from the kitchen (on a plate and not cut up), the prime fries were dry and we had to ask for au ju to make the meat edible, the chicken wings were abismal for the price.

I love the warm but industrial decor, particularly the wood walls where they hang local art. I also like the open atmosphere. 

I've visited this place twice: once for just a drink and once for lunch. Both times, we had really fear servers who were personable and happy to chat about the beers with my very knowledgeable husband. They also give good recommendations. S. loved almost all the beer he's had there (and tried one beer he really didn't like, but the server was helpful in providing details about the beer, so S. can avoid beers made with the weird hops in the future). He also loved his very great gourmet grilled cheese and tomato soup, which wasn't to my taste but was very fresh and had a smoky undertone. 

I did, however, really like my kale salad with chicken. I was particularly pleased with how well they seasoned the chicken. Many places that add chicken to a salad don't seem to feel the need to season the chicken, making it blah--no such problem here. The kale was so bright it seemed like it was straight out of the garden. I also thought the quinoa was a good touch to make it more filling and add some nuttiness to it. I like their wine list, too, and their glass sparkling is a solid one, good enough for food or to just sip on its own. 

Next time we're in town, I'd be happy to return. It's the perfect place to end an afternoon browsing boutiques and the fun 4th avenue scene.",1,7G6WQKuL2di8e0ad8nfR3w

I now have a beautiful healthy rainbow baby girl who just turned 8 months. I am forever grateful to her for all the knowledge she has given me and many other women!!

The owner is rude and obnoxious, he's always yelling and treating customers horribly.

They don't take appointments so you end up sitting waiting for hours, just what everyone wants for what's supposed to be a relaxing treat. But, they will also take in customers that came in after you.

I had to get something from my car and I was yelled at as if I was walking out... there's no appointments and others waiting, so what if I decide to leave? It's my money and I shouldn't feel threatened to HAVE to stay.

I started going here before I went to other places, and realized how HARD and ROUGH they are on my poor nails. They'd be pulsating for a couple days after getting them done. After switching, I realize that that wasn't normal.

Also- their prices are absolutely ridiculous. I got an ombré french nail- short length- with 2 nails small crystal designs. Nothing else added- came to be $96 total.

We pull up around 11am and there's a line out the door. Not sure if this is the norm but as restaurant owners ourselves there's 2 thoughts that come to mind.1) Damn the food must be good 2) Service must be slow. For us seeing a line is a good thing...(in a way). It started to lightly rain so everyone outside was basically screwed. By the looks of the place we thought it was a sit down and have a waiter/waitress take your order place. But this is an order yourself, seat self, bus your table yourself and get everything yourself place. If you expect to be waited on that's not happening here other than when your food comes to the table for drop off. We waited 40 minutes in line before we reached the cashier. The nice and friendly cashier made the wait less painful. After that we had to find an available table that would accommodate 5 people.  The place was busy and no one seemed like they were moving for a while. We got lucky and got the only big table there was. We were waiting so long for our food, my son started crying because he was hungry, and he's 9 btw, he doesn't cry or whine , he quietly started shedding tears, so I went to the counter and asked who ever was behind the counter if they had bread or something to give him. From the time we sat we waited 50... yes...FIFTY minutes before we got our order! That's on top of the 40 minutes in line. Was it worth the wait?... unfortunately not. Idk if there was only one cook, but the wait time to push orders out was insane.  Hubby ordered biscuits and gravy, it was cold when he got it, there's no point in having them take it back who knows how long that would've taken. Daughter ordered the Veggie Reggie, it was ok. Boys got Miesley? The fried chicken, it was ok, and just over easy eggs on a biscuit for the little one. I ordered shrimp and grits, it's was way too thick for my liking it was kinda like dried out oatmeal that looked like mashed potatoes lol. The sauce/gravy was super salty, you can get instant high blood pressure. Also had a lot of black pepper, A LOT, because it gave a kick back like why??? I really wanted to love this meal and was looking forward to it. But it's a no from me. Tip: Make sure you order everything you want at the register, because if the line is anything like the line we waited in, you can fohgetta bout it! If you want a place where you can chit chat all day with your friends and you ain't got nothin' but time this is your place! Otherwise, go towards closing maybe they'll cook faster so they can go home on time. Like I said, maybe we came on a bad day. New Years Day.

The location is deff a plus. It was very clean. The bathrooms were pretty cool they had a TV showing live feed of somewhere in Japan. We stayed in the bar area the entire time, it was very roomy and they had anime (Naruto) playing on the tv behind the bar!!! How cool is that? 

Overall my experience here was great. I left a very happy full customer. Also the price was in-between, not super cheap but not extremely expensive. You deff are phony for quality and quantity of the food, it was delicious and big servings! We got a small bottle of Sake that had 7-8 shots, 1 Japanese Soda, 1 appetizer for two people, 2 bowls of ramen which were big for 52$!

Worth making a trip to Nashville for",1,i_hYOrXiUK2R0rSTDcHaVQ

The service was pretty good, food came out fast. They give you the buzzer, which is very convenient so you can wander elsewhere while waiting for the food.

When one is waiting to be seen it's really inconvenient to have a long wait with no clear indication of when one might be seen. However it's nice to have adequate time to speak to the doctor when it is one's turn. I think they could work on this issue and then be a five star practice.

The space is amazing! Beautiful grounds and lovely facilities. My apartment was incredible. I loved the french grey walls, the appliances, and the spacious rooms. There are hiccups with the maintenance of the building (expect issues with water heating and space heating here and there, and the occasional fire alarm testing gone awry) but it really is worth it if you love old architecture and living in a space with history.

The most important factor, for me, was the interactions with the staff there. I believe that what you put out is what you get in return. My leasing agent, Kayla, was amazing. She always circled back around with me to make sure my requests to her had been closed out. She provided excellent service from start to finish. I also had a few mishaps here and there- including having a package delivered after I moved out - and they continued to help me out even once I didn't live there. Shoutout to the office folk! There are also great tenants ... I loved hanging out with the people on my hall. 

It's super easy access to Kelly Drive and pretty quiet considering how close to Germantown center it is. 

I would suggest trying to get into the parking areas earlier, or perhaps actually purchasing a parking pass for the garage - it will save you SO MUCH TIME.

My wife and I stopped in at the North McCarren flowing tide pub today to find out that it is closed for a remodel. The gentleman working on the floor told me that if I went to the Fourth Street and McCarran location on the other side of the freeway, they would give me a discount for traveling there.. I love discounts! So, away we went. Siri told me I had to do a U-turn at Fourth Street and Mccarran, but the truth is, you don't have to do a U-turn. Take a left turn as you're going south down McCarran at the turn out just before the light. We found an easy spot close by to park, and walked inside. It was quiet and that was very inviting to me. 
I started to look around for a place to take a picture, and Shawn asked if I would let him take the picture. We agreed and the picture with us next to the pirate is the result. He told us about the special of the day and I was immediately finished with the menu! I must say, if I could put together the perfect lunch sandwich meal, it would be today's special. Spicy roast beef, pepper jack cheese, a jalapeño and bell pepper hash, grilled on sourdough bread. Paired with sweet potato fries and a chipotle ranch sauce for dipping. Add a Coors light draft, and you have the perfect lunch sandwich as far as I'm concerned! 
Emily was our server, and what a sweetheart she is! She made recommendations for my wife, and was very helpful. The food was served in a timely manner, and I was in a state of euphoria immediately! I can't understand some of the reviews I have read about this establishment! Today must be my lucky day! Actually, I guess every day is my lucky day, at least most of the time, because I am hard-pressed to give any place I have been to so far a single or two stars! I told Shawn and Emily both they must earn my stars, and they reciprocated by giving me excellent service, the attention I required, and a very welcoming atmosphere.
I understand a bad review. I have written them before. I believe that half of the review comes from the reviewer's state of mind at the time. Go in with a positive attitude, a so-called one star automatically becomes a three star! If your attitude sucks, a five star, will probably be a one or a two star. It's not my job to preach, I'm just giving you my point of view. I choose to see the glass half full. People treat you better when you have a positive attitude. Today, Shawn and Emily were the people that treated us wonderfully! I feel very honored, and I'm sorry that others can't feel like they were treated the way we were today. 
I certainly will be back, and it excites me that I could possibly eat the same sandwich that I had today. Thank you Sean and Emily! I didn't meet Marissa T, but from her response to several reviewers, it seems that she cares about her restaurant very much! By the way, I was apparently in the non-smoking section.

The bacon tomato jam looked burnt and the most important part: the meat was well beyond well done. 

I didn't send it back as this was my breakfast and lunch ( so I was starving) but will never be back there for food again.

Walked out with a week's worth of trial contacts as I was switching brands. No check of the eyes with the lenses in, though, which seemed weird. No hard push to buy the lenses through them, which is always appreciated, and no issues getting the script released after the trial was over.

The LensCrafters side was pretty much what you'd expect. Reasonable selection. Lots and lots of name brand frames which isn't my thing personally because I just use glasses for watching TV at night but I know it's important to lots of full-time glasses wearers. I do wish the process of buying the glasses was more transparent. The employee did lots of tap tap tapping on their iPad and magically came up with an amount. I guess my age is showing but I like being given an itemized list and allowed to take my time reviewing each item. It felt rushed and pressured though I didn't feel I was getting ripped off or taken advantage of.  I just prefer more transparency and a slower pace. It's several hundred dollars if you're getting new frames, transition bifocals, etc, so I prefer to be intentional.

We did quite a bit of shopping around, but nothing beat Brandon Ford's prices, low dealer fees, and transparency. They have the lowest dealer fees out of any of the 4 dealers we looked at ($600+ $100 filing), and they alone didn't try to bait and switch us with ridiculous add-ons (e.g., a $1k unadvertised reconditioning fee... really, Hyundai of New Port Richey??! ).

We pushed them hard on price (and even walked a couple of times), but they couldn't move down much. Which is fair, honestly, considering the car was $1.7k less than the LOWEST end of KBB's fair purchase price, and was quite a bit less than the price other Ford dealers (Walker Ford, Bill Currie) Ford were offering for the same model and mileage.

Although the sticker was a great deal, the out the door price was pushing against our budget-- so Arian Rafhat (our sales consultant) did his utmost to get us to a number we felt more comfortable with. He's a younger guy (20s) so I was a little nervous, but he went above and beyond. He was super knowledgeable and accommodating, and just a nice, smart, capable kid overall. He advocated a lot on our behalf and gracefully dealt with my husband and I squabbling (), so I can't recommend him enough. Far and away the best salesperson I've worked with during this process. 


We did opt to buy an extended warranty for peace of mind, since I have a long commute for work. Usually those things are rip offs, so I had it firmly in my mind that there was absolutely no way we'd bite--but the price was too good to resist. ($750 for a generous extended 60k warrantee? Yes please).

That said, I'm not too worried about anything going wrong with the car. We just passed year 3 with my husband's CPO Fusion Titanium (which has over 50k miles) without as much as a stray squeak. I can only speak from our experience, but I trust Ford, and Brandon Ford's CPO vehicles more specifically. 

I will update if anything changes, but overall, I'm pretty damn happy. The 2018 Hyundai Elantra SELs I considered looked (and drove) like little rinky dink plastic toys next to my Focus Titanium. Great prices and product, outstanding service.",1,yABmSyx4IQiRK2Py22au7Q

Despite not having many reviews, we were drawn by the overwhelmingly positive reviews that Istanbul Café did have. It is a bit off the beaten path if you are out drinking, but is well worth the short walk. You order at the counter and then have the opportunity to customize your toppings when they assemble your meal.

They have a fairly basic menu that includes gyros, wraps, falafel, salads, Phillies, and burgers, as well as several side and beverage options. I ordered the basic Gyro Wrap, and loaded it up with all the toppings. The gyro was phenomenal! One of my companions said it was the best gyro he had ever eaten. My husband opted for the Philly Cheese Steak and said that was excellent, as well. 

There is very limited seating - just a few chairs along a small counter that overlooks the street outside the shop. Sitting there eating and people watching after a night of drinking was the perfect way to end our night. I highly recommend checking out Istanbul Café!",1,ouIfeajiYdt7qMj1tr7e1A

It had homemade dressing and fried eggplant croutons. It was amazing, truly delicious and unique all at the same time. It was perfectly dressed and large in size...I ate it all anyway. Then I tried the garlicky house bread - very good, but I had to save room! When the pork cheek arrived, I was very excited, and it's flavor was better than anything I could imagine. It was so tender you could have eaten it with a spoon and was served piping hot. It was celebrated with a delicious polenta and sauteed fresh mushrooms. It was truly outstanding. The combination was right on and complimented the pork. My friend LOVED her chicken parmigiana and the chicken cacciatore was rich in vegetables with housemade pappardelle.

I would never have thought to put garlic on popcorn. You have to try it! The disco fries were amazing and they were finished within two minutes of being placed in front of me.

My wife and I each had the regular-sized fillet and chips. We loved the light and crispy beer batter on the fish. The tartar sauce was delicious, but we both preferred the malt vinegar for the fish and chips (thickly cut potatoes that were fantastic). It was a simple yet enjoyable meal on a Saturday night, right when the people watching on State Street was getting interesting.

First, he said he would match it, then he beat it by $30.  But the 20% would have been $100 of the quote.

But I figured that $30 was pretty good, cause I pretty much thought that I did have a good quote, so I scheduled the work for the following Saturday.  He said that he would need the car all day.  Strange, the last place I visited said the work would take an hour & a half.  Whatever, he's beating the quote so we'll go ahead with it.

I asked him about any warranty before I left & he stated that we would get a one-year warranty.  GREAT!

OK . . . so Saturday rolls around & I leave my car there @ 9:30 in the morning.  Todd calls me in the afternoon right before I'm leaving to catch a bus to return to pick up the car & proceeds to now tell me that I need 2 different ""filters"" & recharge to the tune of an additional almost $400.  Well, I remembered another shop quoting me $20 for A filter & NO charge to put it on, as they were already doing the work.  So I declined.

Now, he tells me that unless I agree to this additional work, he will NOT guarantee this work.  I told him to just put the old compressor back on the car.  He said that the new one was already on there . . . that it could last me a year or 6 months - ""it should get you through the summer"".  I was like whatever & left to get the car.

I filled a complaint with the BBB & they never answered.  I did some research & located the owner's Accountant.  He gave me some divorce story about the owner & that he was out of town.  I left my # to have the owner give me a call.

Next thing I know, some other guy from the shop is calling me & wanting to know what I want to talk to the owner about.  I finally told him & he offered nothing.

Our wait was short and 5 minutes before our reservation time we were escorted to our table. Service was excellent and our waiter, Oscar, was very attentive to our needs.
The bread was warm, fresh and tasty, and several different flavors were woven into one pull-apart style roll. So good! I love good bread. It was served with butter rather than oil and vinegar, I suspect due to the current covid concessions.
When our salad arrived, my wife and I both shrieked that we had forgotten to specify Iceberg or Romaine lettuce when we saw the rabbit food lettuce. We almost sent it back but given it would only be trashed, we elected to try it. Despite our misgivings, it was so much better than any other spring mix salad we have ever eaten, no tart notes and the dressings were superb. I suspect the Spring Mix is a concession to our tourists.
I ordered the surf and turf special. The steak was huge and heavily marbled; not usually what I would preferentially select, but it was amazingly tasty. Too much fat for my typical steak, but I couldn't fault either the taste or the preparation. The shrimp were perhaps the best blackened I have tasted. They were perfect! Very flavorful with no edge of burnt flavors.
My wife ordered fish cooked to perfection with a very nice sauce to increase the flavor. The presentation was good.
Finally, our dessert. My wife and I shared a Creme Brûlée. The creme was perfect, but the brûlée was truly brûlée instead of the more common just before brûlée and still crispy. It didn't ruin the Creme Brûlée but it wasn't a five. 
I am sure if we had said something, they would have graciously offered us a replacement, but we were full and so pleased with everything that we just chalked it up to a novice oversight.

Fairmount Pizza and Grill seemed to have just the right fix for my late night ""I want bacon on French Fries with gravy and cheese"" craving...but something just didn't mesh...or not mesh properly. For as much fat and cream laden on that pile of white fries, I shouldn't have expected any crispiness...but there wasn't any salt flavoring either. And...after all, what is fat without sodium?

The pizza was fine - the crust rather decadent for those of us heathens who indulge in fat, doughy crusts and slightly undercooked centers. (No, but srsly, this was a good thing.)

I did some research around Sumner County and found Sandi at Fresh Esthetics. This place is literally a five minute drive from my work--BONUS! Upon further inspection, they offer all of the amazing services of a Nashville salon (hard wax being my #1 requirement), and for a fraction of the price. 

The first time I visited, Sandi blew me away with how comfortable she made me feel and how down to earth and REAL she is. Not only did she do an amazing job with my wax, she was really fun to talk to!

Special Instructions:
""CALL  xxx.xxx.xxxx WHEN YOU GET HERE.... BRING PLASTICWARE AND NAPKINS - DEF! -:) DRIVER MUST BE WEARING FACE MASK OR ORDER WILL NOT BE ACCEPTED!!! NO EXCEPTIONS - PERIOD!!! THANK YOU!!!""

Does anyone reading this review have any problem understanding the basic, simple and direct language in these instructions?

Right, I didn't think so!

Would you think that at least ONE part of these simple requests/instructions might have be honored?

Not by Quikfixx!

There are reasons why I prefer to tip in cash, which was how this order was going to go if the driver had ""bothered"" to call me and show his face with a mask on it.

1: I used to work as a waiter for 8 years and I know what it's like to make a living from tips

2. And much more important in today's world, I need to see the driver with a face mask on.

Like it says in my instructions, ""NO EXCEPTIONS - PERIOD!!!""

Frankly, I couldn't give a FLYING F*CK about what ANYONE thinks about face masks anymore.

But when it's my life and health at stake, the lives, health and well being of people I love and care about at stake, THEN WAKE THE F*CK UP, PAY ATTENTION AND SHOW SOME F*CKING RESPECT if you expect to get PAID!!!

The food?

Don't know, don't care, except that it was cold after being out on the sidewalk for g_d knows how long long until I finally called this so-called ""restaurant.""

It's in the freezer now, and will be OUT ON THE STREET with next week's TRASH, EXACTLY WHERE THE DISRESPECTFUL BONEHEADS FROM QUICKFIXX BELONG!!!

I ordered from Domino's. They don't have the same kind of selection, but they never let me down. And I can pay for the whole thing in cash if I want to, which means- no show with face mask, no deal at all.

Figure it out, Quikfixx, because you need a QUICK FIX new way of doing things in today's

WOW, Mr. M!,

You never responded to this review because you knew you didn't have a leg to stand on. So instead, you  chose the cowards way and responded to (attacked) another review of mine in such a ""nice and polite way"" and ""with much aplomb"" (your words, not mine) after CURSING AND SHOUTING AT ME OVER THE PHONE about how you thought that I was trying ""to destroy"" your business.

So Matt, as a business owner and operator of over 35 years (now successfully retired), I can assure you that NO ONE can destroy your business ""better""than you can.

So stop your whining 12 year old quips, grow up, get a grip and learn how to run a business.

I could teach you how it works, but if you treat your employees the way you tried but failed to deal with me...like dirt with your Trump-like, rage filled hissy-fits, it would never work and there's no amount of money that could lure me out of retirement for the likes of you.

After experiencing ONLY ONE of your rage fits, it's no surprise to me that your employees might not do what ""ask"" them to do.

So pay the city what YOU owe the city for your failure to do business in an honest and respectful way.

You've heard from my bank again, so NO MORE GAMES, Mr. M.!

...or I'll see you in COURT, where your cowardly ways WILL finally catch you in your own little boy's bullying game...",3,ZklU1_6EEKp6oap-_QcHig

It sits behind Mil-Lee's Luv - In Diner off Main Street, Yardley, Pa.  You have to drive down the adjoining driveway to find it.  First impression upon parking, Oy. what a dismal place for an ice cream parlor.  That is soon forgotten upon walking inside.  The space is cute, in a claustrophobic way, but the folks are friendly and patient describing their options.  

The Bordeaux Cherry/Vanilla Custard Gelato I had was quite good.  The ice was Black Cherry red with plenty of cherry chunks mixed in.  The taste was cold and true.  The Custard was even better.  Stand up curl.  Great creamy texture. Just the right vanilla flavor.  Very close in substance to Kohr's at the shore.  Nothing wrong with that.  

The regular ice cream was not sampled, but I was very satisfied with this Gelato.  The question of the hour seems to be whether it compares favorably with Rita's?  
To my buds, they are very close.  You can't go wrong with either selection, so it comes down to secondary preferences.  Do you mind consuming from franchises over stand alone family businesses?  Do plastic cups rank over paper containers?  Does your loyalty flow toward Pennsbury or Council Rock or Morrisville?

When this hardly resolved any of my issues, he tested and diagnosed me with sucrose intolerance - which when I did my research, is just a symptom of a larger issue. 

I had asked Dr. Patel if candida was a possible issue and was completely dismissed. A month later, I began suffering from debilitating migraines and all symptoms had gotten progressively worse. 

Six months later, my new and integrative primary did a GI Map test and found that I not only HAD candida but ALSO H. Pylori AND non-celiac gluten intolerance. I am now on the road to recovery no thanks to Dr. Patel.

We've visited for lunch, dinner, and for the weekend champagne brunch.  The brunch does include champagne, mimosa's, etc., as part of the price which is nice if you like that - if not - well to me it's not really worth the money for that.  The lunch/dinner prices are reasonable; but definitely more than your ordinary buffets.

The variety of food is more than reasonable; but it's definitely not on par with the vegas buffets I've had - that's not an issue for me; but if that's your expectation then you're likely not going to be very happy.  The one notable exception is the dessert area as that's very well done.

The food itself is overall above average; there are items that are really good and some that are well not so good.  One thing that stands out for me is their crab rangoon.  That is one of my favorite foods and theirs is better than about any place I've been in the area.  Another item that I've had there that I really liked were their cheeseburger egg rolls.  Not something I've had elsewhere and they were surprisingly good.

The couple of things I would point out are that the buffet at Hollywood Casino (formerly Harrah's) seems to have more choices; and while this may or may not be fair as I said above it's not comparable to the buffets I've had in Vegas.  Considering the price I don't necessarily hold that against them; but I also can't give them five stars either.  If I could do a 1/2 I would've went 4 1/2; but since I can't 4 it is.

There's bovine aplenty... the divine part is completely subjective. You can get your burger on a bun, on top of fries, mac and cheese or greens. The fries and greens are your only gluten free options. 

They have an open kitchen and you can see them seasoning the burgers once they hit the grill. That tells me only one side is seasoned. Please season both sides, I will be eating both sides.

Price point - I would be hard pressed to find someone happy about paying $3.59 for a side of fries that don't come with the burger. They use Kennebec spuds, which are pricey. That's hardly an excuse because if you want a salad instead of fries, that's $4. Are the greens harvested from a location high in the mountains by a celibate monk who comes down once a month to deliver them? Not likely...

Let's talk accoutrements - their ""divine"" sauce tastes oddly like thousand island, but watered down. They have other mayos that look intriguing but I have not tried. Fry dipping sauces will set you back three bucks if you want to dunk your fries. Their housemade pickles come, sweet, hot, sweet and hot or dill. They just miss the briny-keep-me-coming-back-for-that-umami-burst mark.

This and that - I haven't strayed from the bovine side to try the fried chicken sandwich, but it looks good. Beer comes in cans, no draft beer. Other sides like mac and cheese, hush puppies and dolled up fries will fill your belly... and drain your wallet.

They do use high quality ingredients. This could be the reason for the price point. I'm not cheap but I can appreciate value as much as the next person. I'll probably go back, but I doubt I'll be a regular here.",2,2YKkLFeOx-0zRcWp0KUv_Q

We have been having heat issues for awhile now but this week it was bad enough that we needed to do something about it. 


2/09- thermostat went up to 86 and Would not turn off. Our heat is ALWAYS set at 70-72. But it does NOT stop when it gets to that temperature. It keeps running and running until we manually turn it off. This night, it kept running even when it was off. 

2/10- heat got up to 89. Would not turn off again. Had to run AC for an hour to get thermostat to drop down. Put in a Work order. Called the emergency line at 7:30pm and talked to Eddie. He said he didn't have the part with him but Said he'd be over first thing in the morning. If he is an On call emergency maintenance guy, why can't he go to the office and get the part?

2/11- called maintenance twice with no answer. Called office at 315pm because NO ONE ever came by or called this morning and our heat is running at 86 degrees. Was told ""he has other emergencies and will be there when he can, hopefully today."" Made a point to say we have been sleeping in 90degree apartment for two nights now. Called the office at 540 to ask where maintenance was as OUR HEAT STILL WONT TURN OFF. office said they sent their maintenance guys home at 5. Then why were we told someone would be by before 6pm? Why were we told last night someone would be by first thing this morning??? We asked the office what do we do if no one shows up by 6. She said call the emergency line and she will call to check in tomorrow morning to see if it was fixed. THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WE DID LAST NIGHT AND NO ONE CHECKED IN THIS MORNING. 

Are you going to pay our heat bill since it's been above 90 degrees for 3 days straight now?? 

2/12: office called at 10:30, returned phone call at 11:00. She ensured us that someone was coming over as soon as possible. This is day 4 of heat not turning off and day 3 of contacting the office being told that ""someone will be over as soon as possible"" or ""someone will be by first thing In The morning."" It's 1:40pm right now and 81 degrees in the apartment even though the thermostat is set at 82. 4:00 pm finally someone came to fix our heat and said it was one small piece that was needed (a connector?). Also said it has been happening a lot to other apartment units because all the furnaces are very old.

To begin this is not a review on the restaurant end, I've always enjoyed the brunch and have always left satisfied with what I've ordered and the service has always been great. This concerns more with the bar side and the outrageous $20 cover to enter the pool only to leave minutes later because the amount of people was the equivalent to all the people you see in a wave pool at a water park and god knows what's going on beneath the surface. 

I have never seen such a lack of urgency with the bartenders both in the front and in the pool area as was displayed today. I understand what it means to be in the weeds but when your staff is dragging or in their case dancing and having casual conversations with other patrons while there are other people waiting to be served and showing no recognition of how long one individual has been waiting there to order vs. someone who just walked up is frustrating as a customer who was just looking to relax. Staffing wasn't the issue, there was more than enough bartenders to handle the crowds both in front and in the back bar. The issue was bartenders who showed zero lack of customer awareness and were rude to customers when voicing their displeasure at the amount if time they've had to wait.

I was really upset when they closed down and weary about what would open up in this spot. To be honest, I never really intended on going to The Hat. However, I ended up there tonight for a friends birthday dinner. 

The interior is just as trendy as every other trendy place in Edmonton. I can't really even describe it because it didn't stand out to me. It was dark, with booths along one side and a long bar on the other side with stools. We had a reservation for about 10 people, so we were at a big table all the way at the back, right beside the door to the kitchen. The first (inexplicable) thing of the night that I noticed were the 11 TVs lining the walls. The restaurant seems to be trying to come across as pretty upscale, so the TVs showing sports seemed verrry out of place to me. 

We got there around 5pm and there were only a few other people, but as the night went on it got busier and busier. By the time we left at 8:30pm it was totally full. Young, trendy, good looking crowd. People definitely dressed up to dine here, see and be seen.

Our waitress was alright at first, but got progressively more bizarre as the night went on - coming at inappropriate times (like too soon after someone got the menu), not really checking on us during our meal, long delays in bringing drinks, talking really loudly. She lost her friendliness pretty quickly. One of our friends was trying to order a drink that the bartender was apparently unfamiliar with, and me and my hubs caught her giving him the dirtiest look - whoa! I don't want to attack the girl, but I just don't think she was doing a very good job. 

And now onto the food. We ordered a few appetizers to share at first - the bruschetta, wings and fresh baked brie (order three appetizers as a Hat Trick for $28.75). The bruschetta was great, the wings were pretty tasty, but I didn't like the sauce that came with the brie (strawberry and chocolate). I ordered the blue cheese burger with a house salad as my main meal and I have to say, I was disappointed. First of all, it was huge and I had to squish it between my palms to be able to eat it. Secondly, and worst in my opinion, the beef was way too dry. I would expect that from a bison or elk burger, but for straight up beef, it was just wrong. It was hard to eat and I didn't finish it. I don't think I'll ever be back here, but if I did I think the way to go would be to do the Hat Trick. I was disappointed that the menu consisted of solely burgers, hot dogs and sandwiches, as I wasn't really in the mood for any of that tonight. The apps were much better than the burgers. I had a bite of my husbands Canadian burger and it was also just alright. Not gourmet by any stretch of the imagination. 

The second and third inexplicable things I noticed about this place were that 
- It was really quite dim in there to begin with, and they dimmed the lights even further at about 6:30pm. It was beyond dim, and just plain dark.
-At pretty much exactly 7pm, the music switched from Franz Ferdinand/The Strokes mellow rock in the background to loud dance music. This place does not have a dance floor and is not a club by any means. I'm not sure why they felt this was necessary. Maybe at 10pm, but 7pm? I don't think so. 

Sadly, I file The Hat in the category of restaurants in Edmonton that are trying too hard and won't be back. All style, no substance.

* The Silk Hat was a diner that had been open since 1912 and probably hardly changed in that time. Juke boxes at every red booth, a tea leaf reader in the back, waitresses that looked like they were straight out of the 50s, hamburgers as big as your head, and Elvis and Sinatra look-a-likes at the long bar. Out of every place I have been to in the world, I will always remember it as my favourite place. RIP Silk Hat.",5,yFOhA0a7toBwUffjC68FrA

It was 10:45 pm, and the Chophouse closes at 11 pm, but they took our order. The filet was cooked a perfect medium rare that really did melt in my mouth. The shrimp cocktail only came with 3 shrimp, but they were sweet and fresh. The baked potato was the size of a guinea pig!

I must admit, McCormick and Schmicks have handled my experience with the utmost of professionalism.  

The following is our experience is what created quite a bot of discussion within their corporate decision makers. 

There were 3 of us in our party. 
I must say how disappointment we were in the food preparation.

I specifically asked our server about the Raw Oysters. I was specific that I wanted Plump, large, moist and Briney morsels. I also asked about the Clams on the Half Shell and what she would suggest. The Waitress was emphatic that I order 6 of the, ""Ware"" Oysters. 

Upon they being set in front of me, I could not believe she suggested these. They were all TINY, almost dehydrated Mollusks. Each barely, if at all covered the small serving fork provided. They were so small it was silly. I was very clear what I expected and this is what the waitress highly recommended? For 2.25 per Oyster, your Restaurant charges one would think that a customer would not receive such obvious less than quality appetizer.

I ordered the Trout. The portion was nice however it was dry? How could a magnificent Fresh piece of fish be served dry? The Crust was tough to cut through. One guest had the Ahi Tuna, he seemed to enjoy it. The other guest had the Mahi Mahi which she also seemed to enjoy.

Unanimously, the SMALL piece of bread served on the table was ROCK HARD. We know Sour Bread and frankly in this part of the country we really don't see it as a treat, more as a wrestling match to tear the slice of bread off of the rest of the loaf. The crust was just so hard, it was ridicules.

I did put the unit number down, I specifically remember putting it down, but he must have ignored it. ""I put the unit number on there,"" I replied. ""No you didn't. Next time put the unit number!""

I was gonna give the guy a couple of bucks on top of the two dollar delivery fee, but not after that bullcrap. I get to my room and open up the bag and find a hard, COLD burger with hard, COLD fries. What in the world?

The almond croissant was rock hard, didn't rise, and the dough was literally uncooked and raw inside. I tried to change it and the girl tried to defend it instead of just giving me another option or refunding my money. What a joke. Even if the croissant was cooked by Jacques Pepin and flown in from the champs' Elysse on the concorde, which it wasn't, it was garbage, still just exchange it for good customer service. Said the pastry chef may have had a ""heavy hand"" and that it was almond paste, it wasn't. It was uncooked dough and and gave my girl a stomachache. Ridiculous. Don't know if it is worth another chance. We'll see. Have seen a lot of bad reviews on here about staff lately. Bizarre. Try Piquant in Old Hyde park Tampa instead, or Pane Rustica, their almond croissant's are always good and each unique different French styles. More pissed about the reaction to my qualms then the actual fact the almond croissant was inedible, uncooked, and indigestible. The other croissants looked like they were ok, plain and pain au chocolat. Would have been an easy switcheroo instead of trying to explain your way out of an inferior product.

Pro-tip I wish I had read before we had gone -- if you're going for dinner and want to go to the host station, go in the door NOT on the corner, the door that does NOT have the little dandelion lantern-looking sign over it. Otherwise you will wander into the bar area and be confused.... but the host came and rescued us. They probably get tired of doing that lol. While we were there, we watched the hostess constantly look back and run to grab people who came in the wrong door. You'd think they'd throw a sign out front...

The Welsh Rarebit was so good-- it's such a simple food but they left it alone-- it's just mustard and cheese on some amazing bread. It's perfect. 

The bread they bring is so good too- as is the ""fancy butter"" as my boyfriend calls it lol. 

I can't wait to try some of the other starters-- duck and chicken liver, duck and pistachio.... the ricotta.... 

My boyfriend got the Steak and Chips- the herb butter was so delicious, and the meat was so tender. The triple cooked fries that came with it were SO large (i swear it was at least two potatoes) but cooked so so well. 

I got the Sunday roast-- way too much food but I am still eating it a day later lol. The Roast was fantastic, also very tender. The horseradish cream seemed to have a touch of lemon in it, it was really nice. Lovely Yorkshire pudding-- And the veggie of the day appeared to be carrots (either white and orange carrots or orange carrots and parsnips), roasted, with generous (but not too much-- and this is from someone who doesn't normally salt food) salt and I believe honey... my boyfriend really does not like carrots.... well he kept stealing mine! Oh also two lovely potatoes, roasted up all golden brown and perfect. 

The *only* think I wished I had had was extra gravy. I really love gravy lol, and would have loved to have drowned my pudding and steak in a little more.

The desserts... oh man. My boyfriend doesn't like bananas and was warned as he ordered that they were in the banoffee dessert- a+ for the waitress for warning him. So he went the with sticky toffee pudding, which I didn't think he would enjoy, because he doesn't like raisins or any dried fruits... well he nearly ate the entire thing (couldn't force another bite!) and was so sad he couldn't bring himself to finish it completely. It was like warm gingerbread doused in a boozey, buttery caramel sauce and ice cream... phenomenal on a rainy Sunday night in front of the giant bay window. 

I got the petite dessert selection-- I LOVE little foods lol. It was like tapas but for desserts. And there were so many-- a macaroon (grapefruit I believe) 3 delicious short bread cookies, 3 ginger bread cookies shaped as crowns, and 3 coconut cookies.... a brownie with amazing dark chocolate ganache on top, a baby apple pie tarlette, and lemon tart (I do not normally like lemon things but this was such a wonderfully bright bite to end on) and a hazelnut tart. I loved it. I think I am in love with the dessert platter lol.

The front looks just like an English building-- full of green plants. The inside is so eclectic, and adorable. Parts of it look like your grandmas house, parts look like a warm dark British pub, and others are outfitted with Dogs. Very nice bathrooms too-- I loved that the hostess showed them to us on the way up, such a great detail that more places should do. 

A+ service. Our lovely waitress was perfect, super friendly, and not even a little annoyed that I needed her to make my dinner decision for me lol. (Sunday Roast? Crab Risotto? perfectly crispy Pork Belly? Rabbit pie or Rabbit pasta?? I needed seriously help!)

I cannot wait to return-- especially during restaurant week!!",0,YnB8YxgZHcDJrLDoQNy-lw

I've been there many times over the past few years for lunch or brunch and I have never had bad service or a bad meal.

It also happens to be the first place I took my new-born to as we celebrated my birthday last year and they were fantastic about accommodating our needs.  And on the subject, they have always been a fantastic place to bring kids, even when my wife's step-mother decided to change her daughter's diaper on the floor next to our table.  I thought I was going to die from embarrassment. (And yes, they have changing facilities).

Ahem, so anyway, they always have a fun little menu.  You will always find a nice assortment of animal proteins, prepared in fresh, interesting ways.  They also have a lot of options for vegetarians, which is refreshing.  I should also mention that I have always enjoyed their soups.

For brunch, they have a very creative and inspired menu.  Not the standard 'Eggs Benedict, Waffle or Pancake, blah blah blah' typical stuff you get at other places.  They have the standards with nice twists, and a lot of great options outside of that.  (Try the fried green tomatoes when they are in season, you won't be disappointed)

I'm sure the biggest attraction at Kite & Key are the numerous drafts they have on tap, but when it comes to dinner this place unfortunately tanks. Save your money for the other competition in the area, because you can get better food and not feel grossed out and disappointed.

As per custom, we were served hot tea in white teacups.
$3 Thai Iced Tea w/ Tapioca - I wanted a cold beverage on a hot day, but this was on the sweet side.

$8 Roasted Pork & Roasted Duck Noodle Soup -  Several amounts of chopped duck breast with the skin-on, and roast pork sat atop of an abundant amount of egg noodles, soaked in broth. Perhaps I'm not a fan of roast duck noodle soup, but I just don't think it's the best way to have duck. The skin is no longer crispy and the flavor of the meat wanes from sitting in the broth, and the meat also gets a little bit tough. The roast pork, however retains more flavor than the duck, and is just a little bit sweeter. 

$9 Roasted Duck and Roasted Pork on Rice w. Green Veg - The fact that this was served over rice made it taste better already. Not only did the meat retain its flavor, but the juices bleed into the rice, giving the plate a foundation of flavor. The gai lan made us feel a little better about eating all that meat. However, the duck itself wasn't great. It didn't taste like savory, salty, sweet roast duck. Also, the skin wasn't very crispy.

Ten more minutes go by, he comes back and fills our glasses with lukewarm water and says our food is almost ready. Three minutes later, naan - woohoo. The naan is the ONLY good thing about the meal. Ten minutes later we are served with warm chicken curry, tikka masala, and korma. In the curry and tikka, the chicken is so dry, hard, stale, freezer-burned and overcooked two of us can't stand to eat what we ordered. The korma was okay. We got the bill from a different guy - we never saw pur server again until the worst part of the night.

We get seated and order a lobster Rangoon, breakfast ramen, and green tea waffle (not your traditional bougie brunch food, and yes we were starving). We wait an HOUR for the appetizer (lobster Rangoon) which was delicious. It's unlike anything we've had before. Then we wait another FOURTY FIVE minutes for the ramen (I swear our waiter forgot about us at this time.) We ordered the ramen without pork and behold our ramen had pork in it. At this point we can't even find anyone to explain the situation, and were so hungry, without the patience to wait another hour, we decide to keep our food and pick out the pork pieces. we explain our pork situation and the response we get is that we shouldn't have eaten it to begin with. Frustrating. 

Finally, we've been there and waited long enough for our food and just in time the green tea waffle comes. I don't even like green tea but this waffle was phenomenal. Imagine a green tea waffle with Caramelized bananas and pomegranate.  (Oh yes, it's real). A foodies dream. 

We devour the waffle, and our check comes and we have items we didn't order on our bill. We get them taken off the bill, and finally get to leave.

Would I go back? Absolutely, the food was just too good and I'd probably get the exact same dishes. I would just hope that I had a different waiter with better service. (4 stars for the service, 5 stars for the food)",1,GfymV3FZIYQH8OeHHZsiGA

I'm not sure if I ever actually believed him, but I didn't let that stop me from perpetuating the rumor down here in Tampa.  Well, finally at the ripe old age of 39, I decided to ask my aunt about it this past weekend while I was in town.  She said that she did know of places selling ""brain"" sandwiches, but that they weren't actually BRAIN.  Curious, I decided to look it up on the enterwebz, and sure as shit, calf brain sandwiches were once sold in the St. Louis area--not monkey brain.  Apparently, restaurants had to stop selling them once the whole mad cow disease thing exploded, so they moved to pig brains.  We immediately started looking around, and a fellow Yelper suggested Schottzie's.  Having nothing to do, we headed over and ordered one up.  In addition, we ordered TAVERN EGGS (Scotch Eggs), IRISH NACHOS and CHICKEN LIVERS.  Everything mentioned was good, specifically the tavern eggs.  If you've never had these before, you definitely need to try them.  I mean, it's a hard boiled egg wrapped in sausage and then freaking deep fried.  Seriously good stuff.  Down in Tampa, they can only be found in British pubs and they're called Scotch Eggs.  Tavern eggs sounds more appealing.  Or does it? LOL  Either way, they're good.

As for the BRAIN SAMMICH, it was ok.  Big, thick slab of pig brain deep fried and served with pickles and spicy country mustard on swirl rye.  Meh.  The chicken livers were better.

Service was great and the décor was decidedly divey, both huge bonuses for us.  Plus, the Cards game was on, and they were whippin' up on The Reds 13-2, so it was a good day.  My only actually suggestion, get Schlafly's on tap!!!",2,VL12EhEdT4OWqGq0nIqkzw

From the first visit, the food has called to me, beckoning me not only to return to New Orleans, but to this restaurant to re-infuse with the flavors that I love. 

My first time at Cochon was a lunch. I was sat at the bar in front of the kitchen and I got to watch the guys cranking out food in cast iron pans and their wood-fired oven. It was spectacular. And the flavors of the food were unparalleled. The crawfish pie was awesome. The gumbo was the best I tasted in the city. For me, the biggest disappointment that trip was that I couldn't bring my wife there for dinner as we ran out of time.

I returned to New Orleans three months later for a work event. During that trip, a colleague and I went to dinner at Cochon. Again, the food, the service, everything was spectacular. The waitress had quit working in New York to come down and work for a time at Cochon. We had the gumbo (incredible again), and the alligator dish as my colleague wanted to try that. While it was probably the best alligator that I've had, it felt more like a check mark on a tourist list, but my colleague was happy. And then came the rabbit and dumplings -- such incredible flavor we were scraping the cast iron pan to get any last remnants we could. Again, an awesome experience.

So it was with some excitement that we booked Cochon again last night. This time, my wife and I on vacation. I was finally going to bring her to the restaurant that, for a period of time, had us planning our wedding here in New Orleans. We had actually considered having the reception at Calcasieu, the private space above Cochon, simply based on my experiences with the food. Perhaps that helps describe how enamored I was with the food at Cochon. Needless to say, we were excited to finally visit together.

Unfortunately, our experience was not the awesome experience we'd hoped for. First, the restaurant was crowded, perhaps some conference or other event was in town, creating a larger crowd than you might expect for a Monday night. Twenty minutes after our reservation time, we were seated. Recently they've expanded the dining room at Cochon, so we were brought into the larger back room dining area that had lots of seats. and a number of empty tables. Overall, it looked as though they were attempting to manage when people were sat in order to avoid overwhelming the kitchen. 

The food started out great. The crawfish pie was as exceptional as I remember it. The boucherie plate was spectacular. My wife loved it. And when rolls arrived, they were as good as you could imagine dinner rolls being. Somewhere late into our small plates, we placed an order for gumbo and an entree of the rabbit & dumplings. It was shortly after this, that our waiter must have started his second job at one of Donald Link's other restaurants. We sat. And we sat. I ran out of beer. At one point, a woman in a dress who looked like she might have a second job as a hostess came by, refilled our water and asked about my empty beer. Then took my wine order. My wife and I soon found ourselves on the crossword app on our phone. Some time after my wine arrived, our original waiter came back by and told us there had been an error and somehow they lost our order. He then speculated that we'd ordered something different and we re-placed our correct order. The two women at the table next to us -- a similar experience. Although the waiter did apologize to us and the other four tables around us, we were surprised that none of us received a visit from the restaurant manager. 

Now the problem with service issues like this is that, when the food does arrive, you start to question your palate. The gumbo, while still the best that I had in New Orleans this trip, tasted slightly burned to my wife. And the rabbit and dumplings, while quite good, tasted a bit less peppery than I remember. My wife loved it and there was pepper at the table, but the service had already stomped our buzz. We wrapped up, and eventually managed to wrangle our check from our waiter. I grabbed my card, ready to pay, and we watched our waiter go by twice without picking it up. Finally, I turned from my wife and sat, looking bored and facing to the side and staring at the restaurant manager in the corridor between the two dining rooms. Eventually, this was enough to prompt them to pick up the card and process the transaction. 

In short, this is another service review and your mileage may vary. If I was in town again, I would probably try and go to Cochon again -- the food is that good -- but our experience with the service has certainly given us pause. I'll also say that I'm going home without the same craving to return that I once had. You could say that, after years of using Yelp, I was so scarred by this experience that I felt the need to write my first Yelp review.",0,3bkYWJ_YFUAyEOI-mVAcHw

The food is pretty great.  We started with guacamole served with fresh Oaxaca cheese - super delicious albeit a tad over-priced.  I had a chicken quesadilla again with Oaxaca cheese and some of the weirdest sour cream that did not taste like sour cream ever.  I think the best thing we tried was the chorizo burger - amazingly tasty and tender.

Biggest problem was that there was only one waitress and an oblivious bartender. Regardless of protocol, when your only waitress is trying to take orders and feed and water at least 6 tables of at least 4 people a piece (and we were a party of 7), it wouldn't have killed the girl to get off her lazy butt and help the waitress get her tables their drinks. the poor lonely server took forever to come over to take our orders, which meant she took drink and food at the same time and we sat there empty and ignored until she got there. Then it took forever to get the drinks (why she had to make the margaritas herself? i refer you back to the lazy bartender). 

The food came out fast, once we finally got the orders in. But after only an hour and a half (bearing in mind we spent almost the whole first 30 minutes waiting for the waitress to come over) we started to feel like they were trying to push us out the door because that lone waitress was going off shift. Why would you schedule only one waitress for a shift that ends in the middle of dinner???? Oh yeah, we got there at 5:30-5:45 and were stunned to find out they don't have a happy hour anymore, either (boo, hiss)! 

surprisingly, the Salsa was the best I've ever had here-- not much heat, but a delicious pureed tomato, onion, garlic and cilantro mixture. almost like eating Mexican bruschetta... in addition, they've started offering chilled glasses again... so, meh, I've had better...",12,PTuedEpLlBo4gobyOfwlMg

The French toast was unlike anything I've ever had before and really made this brunch spot special. The frittata had large chunks of smooth mozzarella and fresh tomatoes that made it especially tasty. There were potatoes on the side and our waitress brought us some hot sauce that was so good.

Also, NO credit cards accepted - must pay with cash or check.  No salads, no appetizers, just great pizza!

Mash up some green plantains, add some butter and other stuff and you get mangu. It's mashed like mashed potatoes, but plantains. You eat it as if it's like a starch like rice, or noodles.  There are a lot of options you can eat it with.  We tried it with chicken.  It is so good. The plate that you get is humongous. You will get full just looking at it.  You get a huge size of mangu, some Dominican sausage, triangle shaped fried cheese, and whatever entree that you choose.  

Food is served from a hot plate.  They will break it down to you what's available.
.  There is also mofongo which is a a fried mashed puerto rican plantain which they fry and make with pork. You can choose either of the two.  I had mofongo with beef stew.

Next time I am there, I want to have some ceviche and try their whole fish, or shrimp. Their salmon looks really good too. 

The menu is not listed on the website because they have different offerings every day. Make sure to come early because food will be gone.

If you want to try a Dominican drink, then try the morir sonando. That is basically a creamsicle drink.  It is good and very sweet.  They also have home made desserts as well.

When you come in here, you will come in as a customer, and leave as family. Robinson and his crew will hook you up with some good Dominican food. It doesn't matter if you have no idea what it is, just try it, and you will be sold!!!!",10,qjfMBIZpQT9DDtw_BWCopQ

Upon arrival we got a bit concerned. From the outside, the place looks old and sketchy. It hasn't rained since last night yet half of the parking lot was under water (see photos) and at 6:30pm on a Friday night, pretty empty, which is usually a bad sign. OK, this is not starting well.

When we got in, the place was cleaner than expected, and the staff was very friendly. They were expecting a large party but accommodated us anyways. Awash, that explains the empty parking lot.
OK, getting better.

We looked over the buffet and decided on that (see photos). $20/person seemed a bit steep considering the buffet looked relatively small, and......well.....IT'S A BUFFET!!!

Whatever. We're here already. Let's dive in.
Now for the big surprise. The food was AMAZING! Seriously! The chicken was juicy and tender and seasoned to perfection, the sides, salads, rice....holy crap the rice!!! I couldn't believe it. This is actual Mediterranean food! Authentic! Not the crap you get at some places, ON A FREAKING BUFFET!!!

OK, the decor needs a SERIOUS makeover, and the parking lot attended to, all of this would usually mean I would rate it down at least one star, but the staff and for all that is holy the food....they get it back!

The concept of the place is great.  I'm gonna venture to guess this place has gone down hill do the the fact that they are trying to expand.  

I got the original quesadilla as did my 13 year old.  Said it comes with Mango Salsa so I was super stoked!  Only prob was it came with regular salsa, they failed to mention that until we asked after we got our order that they no longer carry mango salsa.  No fresh fruit for the ice teas as I had read and heard they once had.   My quesadilla was so bland and tasted like nothing.  ZERO seasoning.   I honestly didn't eat it.  My daughter loved it, my son loved his kids quesadilla.  

Then it occurred to me why.....and my husband said this.  IT LITERALLY reminded us of the quesadillas at friendly's when we were kids.   And we both agreed!
Sweet potato fries meh.  not crispy, which i know is hard to achieve, but your paying for it to be cooked right.  

We paid $6 for one of ours to get a hot dog, popcorn and a drink.  $8 for our other one to get a cheese quesadilla with popcorn and a drink.  They don't offer combos, everything is an add on even though they say you can ""make it a meal"".  

I felt terrible for the poor girl behind the counter, she was working the drive thru and walk ins while the rest of the people working were running around rowdy in the kitchen.  They have an open window that you can see into there.  Poor kid.  she was very nice and did a good job of helping us.  

I wanted to get a banana whip for the kids to share on the ride home but after the meal, I really didn't want to give them any more money.  

The one positive was the creative drinks.  Who knew watermelon cream flavored drinks existed.  

Sorry Bryn and Dane, we wanted to like it, but it just was bland and not good enough to return.  I give you props for the interior and the message, just wish meal would have lived up to it.

What once was a grassy field in the heart of the city, is now paved over and complete with a cafe and a ticket/information/tourist centre, Tix on the Square.

But you shouldn't underestimate this little square of land. At any given time, it is transformed into a lunch room, activity space, festival grounds, political forum, entertainment hub, or place of leisure. And that's year round! This isn't just a summer spot. (Although, you should be warned, it does get a tad slippery during the winter months.)

Location is also key for Churchill Square. You are a hop, skip, and a jump from the Stanley Milner Library, so you can go borrow a book and then come sit in the square and read. Sometimes, they even bring the books to you with their book sales held in the square.

You're also near the Art Gallery of Alberta, law courts, City Hall, City Centre Mall, Citadel Theatre, and the Winspear.

Hungry? No problem! Three Banana's Cafe is there for you! (Try their pizza.) There are also easily a half dozen places to grab a coffee or a bite within a block from there. And, in the summer, the festivals will have a variety of eats, as well, the food carts will be out. (If Eva Sweet Waffles are there, they are a must!)

Churchill Square has a diverse crowd, wide open space, and infinite possibilities. It's a great spot to spend an afternoon - year round!",1,vi0t612Xq4x5HDbZU_HfHQ

We had a reservation for 11 people (including one small child) for dinner, yet we got 10 chairs, so we had to squeeze one more person in the corner of already small seating.  The food was mediocre and the service was OK. We ordered Hongos con Epazote (mushrooms), which barely came with 4-5 small slices of mushrooms!  Seriously, and it cost $7.50 for that?  It wouldn't be enough even for a 3 year old. The fajitas were nothing but a whole bunch of green & red peppers and a little bit of chicken or shrimp which was completely dry and bland, and, it came with one tortilla per person. I have never seen that anywhere.  There was hardly any flavor on some of the dishes (fajitas), yet some of the dishes (Mole Enchiladas) were so over-seasoned that it was actually inedible.  It took forever for some of our dishes to arrive and the same goes for our drinks. We ordered beers a while back and got them toward the end of our meal. We ordered Guac to go with our meal, and got that at the end of the meal too so we were sending it back but our waitress said that we could keep it and she would not charge us for it.  When the final bill came, there was indeed a charge for it, she never took it off.  We ordered ice cream for the 3 year old for her birthday, we got charged $8.50 for it, when it should have been $2.50.  I would not go here again, nor recommend it.

1 stars for service: 
This probably got the whole night started off on the wrong foot because we were a large party that was made up of individuals attending a conference and we were in need of separate checks in order to get reimbursed from our institutions for our meals. This seemed to cause an issue, first with the server and then with the manager on duty. They proceeded to tell us that they couldn't do separate checks (I asked if all of us came in separately and sat at different tables would they be able to do separate checks...guess what happened next) then the manager came and told us that they could do it but that it would take them a long time. I tried to explain that if they could not do it that we would have to take our business elsewhere. Then I was told that if we wanted to go somewhere else that it was our choice. (Not really our choice if you can't give us separate checks and we can't pay you if you can't do separate checks.) Duh. He then emphasized that it would take a long time to do separate checks but he could do it. (so then why tell us you couldn't because now it just sounds like you didn't want to do it!) 

All of this happened before we even put an order it...so already I had a bad taste in my mouth...that was quickly fixed when they brought out the amuse bouche or steak tartar...perfection in one bite!

5 stars for food: Once we ordered my mouth was back to watering about every dish on the menu. I decided on the scallops...I love scallops! They come in a cigar box and when the server opens it up the smoke floats to your nose and you breath in all the smoky goodness! The first bite of scallop...cooked perfectly. I nice sear on the top and bottom and raw in the middle. The flavor infused in the scallop was unlike anything I had ever had before. this dish was rivaling one of my favorite scallop dishes in Vegas (see my review for Mon Ami Gabi). The potatoes and cauliflower that was included with the scallops were cooked with seasonings that had a lil spicy kick to them...and that complimented the scallop very well. I'm picky about my scallops because I prefer them to be more rare then  well done...these were perfect! The slightest sear to just get a little crust. My mouth waters just thinking about those scallops! I think the food is absolute 5 stars...maybe even 6!

Everyone at the table was happy with what they ordered....from the chicken wings, to pork belly, to duck...the menu offers a great selection of food that is cooked to perfection. The kitchen deserves every star!

The food saved the day for this restaurant. The food is worth every penny. The service was a #fail. PS they did add a 20% service charge which I understand is common practice for large parties, but nowhere else that I went during my time in NOLA did our big party get charged a 20% service fee! Those servers definitely got a bigger tip when they didn't add the fee. I think this server knew he wasn't going to get much of a tip if he didn't force us to pay a service change. I want my tip to go to the kitchen...they earned it!

Maybe, if I go back I'll try going by myself or with one friend and not 12 friends who all spent a lot of money at this establishment with me...maybe, if I go back. There are too many other places in New Orleans to be spending my money and I may have just tried the best dish on the menu. My suggestion, try the place if you have the money to spend and a small party. Don't expect the service to match the delish flavors of the food.",0,TxHx1fb8O_MsfQB_ODdTQg

I ordered the soup and half sandwich option which was reasonably priced and also came with a side of housemade chips. I got the tomato artichoke soup which was topped with croutons and cheese and was pretty good; there were hints of artichoke flavor but it pretty much tasted like tomato soup. For my sandwich, I had the chicken salad; it didn't skimp on the chicken chunks and mayo but it didn't have quite the mixture of crunch with the celery and bacon to give it a bit more variety that I had been looking for it. It was a little bland as well and the sourdough bread seemed to be too thick and overpowering.

http://onerudedude.blogspot.com/2009/08/from-housewarming-to-hospital-visit-in.html

This being a 'bad' review, I'll start with the Cons and work up to the Pros.


Cons
-Rude guy at the intake counter made my wife stand and deliver the details of her life while bleeding from the leg - he wouldn't let her sit down or fetch a wheelchair before getting such crucial info as SSN and DOB.
-Long, long waits between intake: arbitrage: hospital room: doctor's first visit: x-rays: doctor puts in stitches. Total time in Hospital was 5.5 hours for 1 x-ray and 8 lousy stitches - plus which it didn't seem very busy. I guess it only takes one guy with massive head-traume, but I'm just saying.
-Rookie Moves by the Residents: when the young doctor finally appeared and cleaned the wound, the sight of which gore had previously caused my wife to faint, he stuck his index finger in the wound up to the first knuckle and asked 'wanna see something cool'?  Later that night, one of his stitches popped out. Not cool.
-Surly/Lazy Staff: I asked for blankets cause it was cold and didn't get any so I had to help my damn self. When I came around again to beg some pain killers I saw about 10 people behind the counter surfing Facebook and giving each other back rubs, while rolling their eyes at my requests.
-Jerks tried to give me a parking ticket for leaving my car with flashed on in their little ER drive-in area while I carried my hobbled wife inside.

Pros
-I still haven't seen a bill (could ultimately be a Con).
-Close by my place.
-TVs in each waiting room.",6,V_v4CXivF4myItNH1wwG4g

I have to mention that on our wine list we intentionally had bottles under $15 which for a restaurant is a real bargain. It was not the best wine I have ever had, but for the price I was impressed.

I started with the crispy gnocchi with a center that melted in your mouth accompanied by wonderful roasted brussel sprouts. My next dish was the Bacon and Eggs Pillow and this was the show stopper, seriously if you go get this dish. It is one large ravioli filled with cheese and and egg yolk, covered in a buttery bacon sauce..Amazing! That was a tough act to follow so I don't know if I was still coveting the egg ravioli or if it was just too much egg, but the Steak and Egg course didn't wow me. Basically a small piece of ok steak with a fried egg on top, not bad, just nothing special. 

I am not sure if it is an intentional theme but the dessert menu seems to be about fooling you. The Sage Blue Cheese and honey come as 3 little cheese balls rather than pieces of blue cheese, the Apple Pie is good, but should not carry the name apple pie because it is not, I would call it more of and apple danish, or apple struddel..its just not a pie. Speaking of things that are not what they appear  The most interesting desert is the baked potato..when they bring it out it looks just like a baked potato, I was even fooled into thinking they had put the ice cream into a potato skin, but learned it was just gelato rolled in cocoa, topped with whipped cream, and real bacon. I wanted to take one home to fool my kids!

I had the Giwa Signature Bibimbop with spicy pork.  This was good, not my favorite of this dish (and I wish they had some octopus) but a solid overall dish.  Especially for the eat and run setting.

On May 14, I had just driven two hours south from Fort Wayne after attending my father's funeral. It was after 11:00 pm; I was tired, grieving, and weary of the immense weight upon my shoulders as the only son and executive of my father's estate. My flight back to Austin left at 7:30 the next morning, and I thought being right next to the airport would make the morning a little easier. I had reservations using a $100 gift card purchased from Choice Hotels, Clarion and Quality Inns parent chain. When I arrived, I was told that this particular location would not accept the Choice card as payment. Instead, they would only accept a credit card or cash despite assurances that we called ahead to make sure they would accept the gift card as payment. I demanded to speak to a manager. The clerk refused. I demanded to speak to the owner after the clerk called him. Again, she refused. I called the phone number for Choice hotels and demanded they honor the card but the national number refused to assist me. The best they could do was suggest staying at the Quality Inn ""which we show is just a short distance away!"" ""No,"" I grumbled. ""It's the same building with the same clerk."" Despite pleading with both the clerk and customer service relaying what I did that day, how far I had traveled, and my early morning flight leaving in just a few hours, no one would do anything to hep me. No empathy, no acknowledgement, nothing. So, at midnight, I drove to several other properties trying to find equitable accommodations. After a number of  failed attempts, I finally found a place to stay at an hour later. The clerk was rude, obstinate, and recalcitrant. No one should ever stay here.

We decided to venture to downtown St. Pete because it has been a while for us since we moved.  We were greeted by the hostess outside and she sat us right away at a booth inside next to the bar. Smack dab in the middle of the bar is a huge mirror. Love it, I don't know why but it makes me think of the 1960's diner style. Eh, I'll go with it. Our server is a very friendly, he greets us asking of our evening. Starts off by telling us, we can have an awesome relationship and let it blossom, or just eat and drink and ditch. Not sure how to really take that intro. He was knowledgeable on the beers as I can no longer drink wheat beers and the Strongbow keg was kicked. He asked, ""Can I make you a cocktail?"" I say, ""sure"", he whisks away. My husband had tasted a few beer samples of different IPA's. He returns with my husband Lagunitas and the #3 cocktail for me. Vodka, raspberry and ginger. Garnished with a single raspberry on a wooden knotted toothpick. Sweet and delicious.

For our meal, we split the Korean Wings, Pho Rolls, Clam chowder & the Airline Chicken. My oh my! What a treat this place was for us! To start, the pho rolls were so fresh. Almost like the real pho bowl deal, the flavor of the pork bursts in your mouth. The crunch of the bean sprouts and the soft fluffiness of the bao bread. The Korean chicken wings were the best! A hint of mandarin and ginger play on the back of your tongue. Succulent wings lots of meat! Nothing dinky about them! 

Let's now discuss the Airline Chicken. Ok, jalapeño cornbread and chicken topped with Brunswick stew? Can we say YUMO!? My husband doesn't like corn....bad experience as a kid, and I was worried that he wouldn't try the stew.....but he did!  Seriously this dish is a true comfort food that I want to eat when I'm pregnant. Chicken breast, thigh, & leg with two jalapeño cornbread and all topped with Brunswick stew.

The only drawback about the restaurant is that it's a LONG drive from Center City (which is where I am most of the time).  Aside from the restaurant's remote location, I have to say that the drive is worth it, especially for their duck! NOTE: I'm the type of person  that likes a dish and will continue ordering it each time I go until I've finally gotten my fill, so I've tried the duck more than a handful of times (and am still ready to go back for more...).

Their duck is cooked to the T, and their black bread and cherry/wine stuffing is the perfect compliment.  I don't know how they manage to get such an amazing balance between crispy and moist for both the duck and the stuffing, but they do... every time I go! Yum.

My husband had the tuna starter, the steak as an entree and the ricotta donuts for dessert which were phenomenal (very rare that I ever regret ordering a chocolate dessert but that was the case here - these donuts are insanely good). The meal started with a yummy amuse bouche: jalapeno cornbread with candied shortrib jam. 
Service was impeccable, on par with Michelin-starred restaurants. I mentioned when ordering that I don't eat pork and they brought out one of the breads that had bacon in it on a separate plate (I'm not that scrupulous and don't care if my food touches something that contains pork, but I really appreciated the effort).

I left with mixed feelings: I had a room the first night that had another room on top. I felt the people upstairs were jogging in their room or something, and I could hear every step. For the second and third night, I changed of room and went somewhere with no one else on top.

Positive points:
-Affordable rate
-Clean
-Quiet (unless you get one of the rooms with someone else on top of you, in which case you'd better pray that they walk slowly and quietly)

Neutral:
-Front Desk staff was just ok. Not particularly friendly or helpful, not particularly rude either.
-Breakfast: many things to choose from, but all very unhealthy. The only fresh thing available were oranges. Everything else was processed food. I would have appreciated some more fruits, some vegetables, meat, cheese, etc.
-Restrooms were clean but old.
-Location is not too bad. I didn't have a car, so I used public transportation. The bus stop is located across the street. However, should I go back to Santa Barbara without a car, I think I'll get a hotel closer to the lovely downtown area and the beach, because coming back and forth with buses ended up being a pain in the ass (they are often late and slow and stop running pretty early -bad if you want to go out at night-)

Negative:
-The pillows are miserably uncomfortable. Instead of having 4 per double room, I'd rather they had just 2 good ones...
-My room did not get any sun light at all. A bit depressing. 
-Showers were (in both rooms) far too small. I am 6'0'' and I had to bend my knees for the water to wash my head/hair. 
-The WiFi connection was really, really slow and kept going on and off all the time. The best you could do with that was to send a couple of e-mails. I ended up using my phone's Hot Spot, which was much faster and reliable. This was kind of annoying, since I had to work a couple of hours every day and together with the lack of sunlight in my room it made the whole experience miserable.


I would come here again, but only with a car. And I'd be aware that the room is not an awesome place to work, because of the lack of a real internet connection and any sun light. 

Otherwise, Santa Barbara is just a lovely town.",0,0w5UVm0d9EHqtZKm4LaESQ

I don't treat myself to breakfast during the week very often but after having an early appointment I knew I wanted too. Squeeze In was my first choice. Surprisingly, I was feeling a healthy breakfast this morning so I went with 
Shi's Super Food Scramble.

It's scrambled egg whites with grilled fat-free turkey, peppers, and spinach served with toast (served dry, of course) with a fruit cup on the side. I decided to get my sourdough toast buttered as a splurge. I couldn't resist. Their sourdough is so incredible I could eat that for a meal on its own! I love it that much. The egg white scramble was a good mix of veggies to give it a crunch and some good flavor. It was very filling and the fruit was very fresh.

This visit made me think I should treat myself to breakfast in the middle of the week more often! I loved being in this place without it being stuffed to the gills, like on the weekends.",1,0jkLS0JLIqeGDXleUw-cDQ

Unfortunately (for us, not them), we didn't get to hands-on work with Dara too often (she was busy having a baby!), but she was ultra-supportive and super responsive with anything we needed/asked. She even sent me a ping to see if I needed help finding any vendors! (P.S. We found our photo booth, hair stylist, and make-up artist through them). 

On our wedding day, we worked with Austin and one of their super-cool employees, Nick. All my bridesmaids LOVED Austin, and the guys had a blast with Nick. We just got our final pictures, and they are so incredibly amazing! They give me goosebumps just to look at. Everyone that has seen them has raved about how stunning they are!

Walking in to an empty host stand I wasn't acknowledged for atleast 5 minutes as servers are walking right past me. I look in the dining room to see at most 5 tables occupied with one large party (15 people?) in the center of the dining room. As a manager walks to me to ask how many people, I was first alerted by his stand off attitude. 

Sitting me at a booth, I notice how beautiful the interior of this new place is presented. As I look at the drink menu there were many great options, so I decide on there lychee martini. However, I noticed I haven't even been acknowledged by any wait staff yet. It had been almost 10 minutes until my friend arrived and then the time had come for us to be finally greeted. Our server was super friendly and asked for our drinks as we put in two appetizers, the jalapeño  calamari and chicken potstickers. So we got our drinks promptly and then waited and waited and waited....

As my friend and I were enjoying our beautifully prepared drinks we had noticed that 30 minutes have gone by with no food in site and no contact with our server. We thought to ourselves,""Ok, we will give it another fifteen minutes until we say something."" Until we could flag down ANYONE it had been an hour with no food! We pulled the manager to our table and stated our concern and he was not accommodating or pleasant at all. ""Well you need to understand that we our busy and understaffed right now"" he states in a snappy tone while I'm thinking, ""Frankly, that isn't my problem that is yours.""

So here comes our calamari minutes later with no potstickers, ran by a random waiter. We promptly told him our entree choice in hopes to not start a trend. As our drinks were going down we decide to be self sufficient in this fine dining restaurant to get our new cocktails at the bar, since who knew when we were going to see our waitress again. 

By the time we got our second appetizer we had been at Hiro for an hour and a half. They were delicious and obviously house made. The bartender walks up and gives us two shots ""on the house."" Thirty minutes had passed until I finally receive my entree, some pork dish, and my friends food was in no site. C'mon guys! Awkwardly waiting for her entree to arrive I start to lose my appetite from the bad taste this establishment is leaving in my mouth. When her dish finally arrives (ramen) I try my pork and just wasn't impressed. As we flag down the manager to ask for our check, since our waitress has pretty much fallen of the face of the earth, I tell him I'm just not impressed with my meal and had lost my appetite from the excessive wait I had gone through. Sure he hates me, as his glare at me implied as he reluctantly tells me he will take it off our bill. 

Bringing our bill promptly we review that he had taken off our appetizers but had charged us for our ""complimentary"" shots ?! My friend brings this too his attention and he is not apologetic at all. What kind of manager is this? He blurts out, ""Well what do you want me to do?!"" My friends simply states to take the shots,we didn't order, off our bill. 

As we paid we could not wait to get out of there! It's a shame because the drinks are awesome and the food is pretty great but customer service gets an F.",3,2tj6ZJGOEEQMhLzvzO_UQQ

Luis was great to work with ahead of time and was very accommodating.  Most places refused to split the time for which we used them or had a minimum time requirement, but Luis let us reserve some cabs for 30 minutes in the afternoon and then another one for 4 hours at night, plus one more for an hour at night (which turned out to be driven by Luis himself!).  This was perfect to meet our needs and save us a bit of cash (instead of booking someone for the entire time).  The cabs showed up on time, got our guests to the wedding on time, and stayed late for our stragglers at the end of the night.  

My only complaint is that he charged extra for one of the cabs to make a second trip even though it was still within the time frame we reserved the cab for (we paid by the hour/half hour instead) and did not tell me about it until I asked him after getting the receipt.  Then the amount he said was charged extra was still less than the difference between what I authorized him to charge to my card (including tip) and the amount that was charged.  However, he responded quickly to my question and was great to all of our guests (even the ones who were a bit crazy at the end of the night!), so I still think Luis and Paradise Cabs deserve 5 stars for their services at our wedding.

I checked their return policy and it reads, ""If you are not completely satisfied with your purchase from us, you may return the product to us within 60 days of your purchase for a full refund."" I called them today (2/27/16) and spoke with their rep and she informed me that I cannot make a return as the bag had been opened.

I also signed up for the ""Auto Ship"" for every two months and found out today that they cancelled my order as Pet Food Direct does not have this brand available.

DO NOT BUY from Pet Food Direct.

Their Manhattan is on tap - they make it in bulk and then barrel age it, which results in a smoky, almost caramely (but very potent) cocktail.  The margarita has a sugar/salt rim, which is nice.

We sampled a large number of small bites.  The oysters (we had the Kumamoto and Kusshi) were fresh and sweet, and we very much enjoyed the deviled eggs, which come with some smoked salmon.  The burrata was lovely, and the pork ribs were exceedingly tender, with a nice balance of sweet and savory - they also came with chunks of nicely pickled watermelon.

Located in a humble strip center on Rowan Road, the establishment can be easy to miss. We had 6:30 reservations for 12, first red flag, table was set for 11. The restaurant was quickly filling up with diners & there were a few waiting by the door.
IMHO, management needs to bring a consultant in to remember the basics of running a restaurant. We were seated as we came in & given bar & dinner menus. Our waiter, I believe his name was Josh, did his very best despite, the lack of cooperation from an inadequate kitchen & missing management.
Only 1 person ordered an appetizer, yet the entire table had to wait over 40 minutes for a lackluster salad that is probably packaged & just waiting for their "" homemade"" dressing.
I was second to order my food & it arriev&ed last, on my way out the door.
The lo mien dishes had hard undercooked noodles. The shrimp salad, looked tastess & after a bite it was. The shrimp were not as small as cocktail shrimp, but they were small a little over a half inch & sparse, as was the dressing.
I love trying new experiences, restaurants & foods. I will gladly wait in line at a food truck, while the owner slaves to prepare everyone's order.
 At an average restaurant, if management doesn't have the respect to come tell me why my food is taking over an hour to prepare, I loose respect. This is what I experienced tonight. Once the respect is gone, why waste more time on food.
If this was fine dining & the menu said to expect a wait, no problem. I can work with about anything, if management communicates & doesn't hide. There is NO way there was adequate kitchen staff.
I'm really sorry I missed my food, but after that long & everone was eating, no respect was left. Decor average, Sunday brunch sounded good, but so did tonights menu with no specials.

I should have run for the door when I opened my menu to see a human hair stuck to it and we had to have our very greasy table wiped down. After a wait, we ordered our drinks. After another wait, we ordered our meals. My friend ordered the ham scrambler with toast and a side of pancakes and I ordered a traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon crisp, hash browns and pancakes (whole grain). Our server was very nice and answered any questions. Twenty minutes later our meals arrived. Our server asked if we had everything we needed and my friend told her silverware would be helpful and that her toast had been forgotten. Five minutes later (while our meals cooled), we got the silverware which I had watched our server roll inside napkins while we waited. Our food was okay. My bacon was cold, hash browns lukewarm, eggs warm but not hot.

At some point, our server came by to check on us, and we once again requested my friend's toast. After a third mention when her meal was almost done, she got the toast.  

We then ordered cherry crepes and I requested a refill of my unsweetened iced tea. I also requested that she bring the check when the crepes were served. A few minutes later I was served some sort of carbonated something - definitely NOT iced tea. Our server took it away and then we waited. And waited. And waited. No crepes and no iced tea. Finally, our server came back and apologized to us (for the umpteenth time throughout our visit) and told us she had forgotten to tell us the kitchen had run out of cherries. I mentioned the iced tea and told her never mind, She did bring me a small go cup of iced tea anyway.  

Ten minutes later we got the check. Their checks are the old-fashioned handwritten checks with an adding machine print-out attached. So there is no real way to know if it is accurate or what charges go with what item. We took the check to the cashier. 

While heading toward the cashier, we noticed him rubbing his hands through his somewhat greasy, somewhat long hair. Then he raised his hand to pick at his eyelash. While I signed the credit card bill I quietly mentioned it would be nice if he kept his hands out of his hair (I didn't mention the grease). Oh boy, was that a mistake. He raised his voice and told me that he doesn't handle food. I told him he handles my credit card, pens, etc. He told me he was sure that his having touched his greasy hair would be just terrible for my card. Then the manager type person standing next to him chimed in that his running his hand through his hair would be awful for those carry-out orders he handles, too.

The rooms are nice, clean and the beds are very comfortable. 

I like the fact that they supply water bottles and coffee for guests. 

The pool area is very nice although I don't agree with only supplying shade to those that pay for it. 

$300 for a cabana and $150 for a shaded umbrella area? 

That's ridiculous. 

I think that if you are a paying guest at the hotel, you should have shade anywhere you sit at the pool. 

The hotel is very Smokey due to the fact that the casino is right across from the hotel check in area. 

Other than that, the hotel itself is very nice and my family and I had a very nice time.",0,qwpIjjC79YvN9jjfOpvNJg

Def a hipster vibe sans the douchey pretentiousness that overwhelms Billyburg. I'm from Philly originally but now reside in the island of Manhattan, but it is always fun to come back to the first city I called home and see how it is constantly changing and evolving. This spot is a prime example. Since it was nice out we sat outside and there was lots of good people watching and funny dogs groveling for table droppings. 

I sat outside with a wonderful Philly Yelper and we ordered Bloodys which arrived quickly. The brunch menu had at least 4 items that caught my eye and then I was handed the specials menu that had about 4 more. It was a tough call but after asking the waitress to confirm that the biscuits were baked in house, I landed on the sausage and eggs on cheddar biscuits. They were drowned in a thick gravy and totally filled me up. My fellow yelper had no complaints about the huevos rancheros and the bite I had was 2 legit to quit. My only complaint would be that both dishes had sprinkled cheese on top and I would've liked to see the cheese melted/blended into the dish, not really thrown on top like an after thought.

So it was with great skepticism and low expectations that I ordered, nose haughtily high in air, from here for the 1st time. As when trying any unfamiliar restaurant, no matter what reviews say, I never stray from conservative choices. Thus, dinner comprised of butter chicken, goat curry & garlic naan. I don't get excited over butter chicken because, well. it just isn't that exciting a dish--more of a comfort food for me. However, Hubs & Teen Thing love this dish, and I was very surprised at how good (& almost exciting) it was with tender chunks of perfectly prepared chicken flawlessly incorporated in a rich, flavorful & aromatic gravy. If that surprised me, the goat curry was a shock. Succulent pieces of goat cooked slowly, in a sauce redolent with ginger & exotic spices, married all the flavors that sent me to glutton heaven. The naan was very good with just the right amount of garlic.

Be prepared to be transported to another place. Filled with music, fruits and vegetables, tamarind candy, a parking lot full of yard sale like stands, and the best damn taco truck in town...El Gordo... El Rancho Swap Meet, AKA, the Flea Market is 'The place to be' on a Sunday morning in my opinion! ... (With an emphasis on morning! It's not as crowded)

My first trip to this magical place was Easter Sunday with my BFF Sara, raving about how amazing the place is. The music was fun, the electronic bull bucking and the whole place was alive, thriving with people. I have since become addicted, making a return appearance to every single swap meet since then!

I can't get enough! I have a system down... We start by walking through all the sale lots. People out there selling ALL KINDS of things. We usually find some old movie we haven't seen in decades, or stumble across new toys for our son... We happened across a brand new black and decker children's work bench retailing for 50$ everywhere else...walked away with it for 7$!!!! He LOVES it!! That was such a steal...

Then we make our way over to the fruits and vegetables... Like a farmers market, the Flea Market always has some really cool things. I came across a Durian fruit and tried it! That was quite the opportunity... (As I have only seen these fruits on food network television shows haha!)

After getting some fruit/Veggie/ or nuts of some kind... It's time for candy!
The candy stand is WORTH it. I usually get tamarind everything... And some Lucas/Mango suckers. I can't get enough of their little jelly cups too... Hmm candy... 

Finally, we finish our day at the Flea Market with tacos from El Gordo Taco Truck. I've looked them up on every platform... and I just can't find them. I don't think they're on Yelp themselves and I don't think they even have a Facebook page because I  have failed in every attempt to find anything on them! Sigh.

That being said... They have THE BEST fricken tacos in town.. The ones I like the best, I can't pronounce. Or spell... Champichanos maybe???? I know, that's wrong... But they'll know what you mean... Asada Tacos with Chorizo and Nopales... And the grill is stationed right outside the truck filled with meats, peppers and cactus...It's my literal heaven! 

The guy manning the grill hands me a grilled jalapeño for my five 'champ' tacos, I add cilantro, onion, hot sauce and grab some limes... Get a horchata from inside the concession area...and I'm in actual taco truck heaven... These guys really have it down. Apparently they park on terminal sometimes... Just look for a big orange taco truck!!

(If you find this truck anywhere other than the swap meet on a Saturday or Sunday... You've found the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow you lucky little devil you...) I would actually say that sometimes, I get myself up out of bed Sunday Morning with the Tacos as my reason why because I can't ever find their truck anywhere else!!

Thanks to El Rancho Swap Meet, Sunday-Family Day at the Flea Market is now my husband, son and I's favorite thing to do together. We look forward to it and those tacos every weekend.",8,wd-8dX8iFJYGoCKDESgbzA

This will be a long one though, so be prepared for some reading.
BF motorcycle and he dropped it on the side and broke the foot peg mount, so back to the shop it goes. He had some scratches on that side and a broken directional that we bought a replacement for and didn't put it on yet. We brought it to these guys, the only ones we trust that do the job right. The BF gave them a whole list of things to fix. The brake rotors, foot peg mount, paint all of the scrapes on the fairings and put in the directional and he wanted his wheels painted red now to match the rest of the bike. If I can get a picture of the bike, I will attach it later. It is a 1991 Kawasaki ZX-11 Ninja we had painted white with red accents and put a lot of work into it. That year was black and rose and he didn't like those colors. It took the shop weeks to find a foot peg mount. The cost for just the wheels to be painted was $600. Another $200 for the touch up painting. We put down $800. We got a call the fork seals were leaking, another $200 and they said the battery also needed replacing..grrrrrr that happens when it sits not running for months, the battery was less than 1-2 yrs old and was fine when we dropped it off..they should've disconnected it or put a trickle charger on it.. Weeks later, we came up with $1000 to put toward the total cost..the total after the $800 was another $2400 and change but he said ""for cash price, it will be $2200 for you guys since you are such good customers"". When I wanted to drive to pay the $1000 cash, my car starter went out. I called and made a cc/dc payment over the phone. I talked the owner into the cash price when I paid the remaining amount of $2200 cash. For some reason, we didn't get a receipt or ask for one. I guess we were too excited to get it back and I made sure they didn't charge for storage to get the full amt paid to get it out. Total price was $3000. That's a lot of money!...The day finally came...We went to pay for the bike not noticing it was outside by the front ready to go. Beautiful, perfect, OMG the wheels, etc.....wait..........OMG, the seat has a tear in the material...BF not good with confrontation. I ran inside and no one was at the front. I got the mechanic that worked on the bike to go outside. He shrugged it off, saying the cost cracked it since it is older material! Those cold frosty nights in the 30's temps must've did it. He tried to find me a place that would give us a good price on the upholstery, but couldn't find it, he just said the area on the other side of town where it is located.
???Why didn't anyone call us as soon as they saw the tear to ask if they could get a quote on a price or at least let us know it happened????Couldn't they have prevented it by covering the seat and isn't it temp controlled in the shop or was it left outside? Aren't they partially responsible for the cost? We decided on an expensive future option of having it recovered in red instead of black anyway. Not happy at all about this though. WHY would a reputable shop that did such beautiful work and we spent so much money let this go without taking at least partial responsibility, even if they say it is old and act like it was just an ""Act of God""??? If I were the owner, I wouldn't let this perfect experience become bitter sweet for my customer. I put duct tape over it and am still disappointed to this day. BF doesn't want me to call them to complain since he wants them to fix the transmission for the gear that sticks 2nd) and doesn't want to ""ruffle feathers"".

It took forever for someone to get to our table to take our drink order. Then we waited some more and the appetizer (crab won tons) came out before we had waters, let alone drinks or appetizer plates. So we all ate off the won ton plate. They tasted a lot fishier than I would have liked. Canned crab?

Finally our drinks arrived and service was fine from that point on. 

Next I had the shrimp and lobster tacos in jicama wraps. The first taco had only shrimp and lobster on it (no sauce or garnish) and was not spicy as the menu said it would be. It was okay, but nothing exciting. The second taco was oilier and saltier, but still with only shrimp and lobster. The third taco was very oily and very salty, with a ton of brown fried bits (like from the bottom of the wok), some green onion, and ONE thin slice of a red pepper. It was not spicy. 

This wasn't a bad experience, but I definitely expected a much higher level of service and culinary skill. I can't say I'll be back any time soon.",2,4T_cokr3XlVm3iYf847aqg

Well it is me and the wife's birthday weekend so I wanted to surprise her and take her to this place. 

1) The hostess was extremely friendly. 

2) Our waiter was nice, but he took forever to get back to us. It was literally the slowest service we ever had and I was surprised to be honest. 

3) While we were eating a woman two tables down let out a shriek and it was a mouse running around the tables when we were eating outside. It was not a really good first impression to be honest. 

4) The food was fresh, tasty, and hot and we were impressed with the meal. I ordered a garden scramble with sausage and my wife ordered the steak tacos. I also ordered the charred cauliflower and it was great. I ordered the bright eyes drink and it was good. 

5) Really overpriced. Total meal with my wife's drink came out to over $60 and that was not including the tip.

I am generally not a fan of them but when there was a sign posted saying world famous, I figured I had to try it.  This was the first time that I actually enjoyed it and thought about getting another one.

The line to get in can be really long. In order to not crowd the inside of the restaurant they will have people stand in a queue outside and then allow about 10 or so people to go in.  When you get in you still have to stand in line.  The way the line is it does feel like a greasy old diner and almost reminded me of a soup kitchen line but not free of course.  While you are in line you will pass the area where they have some of the food but you order when you get to the cashier.  They are one of the few places that will take credit cards thank god!  
Once you place your order, you take your receipt and drink with you and find a table.  This isn't clear when you first get your receipt.  You can sit anywhere that's open and then the staff will come by and take your receipt and bring back to the table.  One of the waitstaff was a bit rude and seemed annoyed by me asking her anything that I was scared to ask her anything like how do I get my coffee. Eventually she became nicer but  I'm guessing she probably realized I was not drunk and wasn't being rude to her.  
I ordered the waffles with blueberry compote.  It was good but I wouldn't say anything extraordinary.  By far I think I was just impressed with how good the bloody mary was!  Too bad there was no where to just order a bloody mary from without having to stand in the line!

We are not quite sure why but every picture on the wall had monkeys doing something different.  It was a little strange and did not really have anything to do with the rest of the decor.  The kitchen is an open concept so you can see right in.  Good news the kitchen was very clean and uncluttered.  The wait staff are dressed in black and white standard uniform.  Within 2 or 3 minutes of being seated our server came to get our drink order.  She was sweet and soft-spoken.  Of course you know I had to ask the server questions about some menu items.  She answered a couple of the questions and the questions she did not know the answer to she immediately went to ask someone and came back with the answer.  That was impressive.  The brunch menu is very simple with not much on it.  We were told it changes every few months depending on the seasons which is nice so there is always something new.  My wife ordered the Lobster Benedict.  It was very well executed.  Poached eggs were cooked perfectly.  Lobster was exceptional.  I had the French omelet with ham and cheese.  Unfortunately, it was overcooked to the point of almost being burnt.  There was very little ham and cheese in the center.  I was very disappointed.

It's a large wooden structure playground with little forts, slides and all manner of fun stuff for kids of all ages to discover.  It's even more fun than it looks in the photos I posted (methinks at least).

The structure is really large & adults can can follow their kids most places on it if so desired.  There are just a few spots where a young child could really take a tumble to the ground below, but that's the hazards of childhood.  I kept a sharp eye on kid #1 until pretty recently.  He loves this playground the best out of our small rotation though.

There are also swings, a balance beam thing, slides and a sandbox.  Picnic tables are around for parents & there's a small pavilion area I've seen co-opted for birthday parties.  I don't think they do reservations like at Chestnut Branch park in Mantua.  There's a much larger pavilion there, but the playground itself is not nearly as nice.

Everything was fantastic, the food was very delicious, and the service was very attentive and great. The food was delicious, but for the small plate portions, I think it was just too expensive, which is the only reason I'm deducting a star from this review.  $10-$15 per plate for tapas style. But, the food was delicious, and maybe if we didn't over-order, we could have kept our bill under a reasonable amount. But, we kind of had to over-order, because the plates were so small.
We seriously ordered almost everything, so here's my run-down:
- Scallop: soo delicious, but sliced thin scallop, not plump like you're used to seeing. $12 was too much for this small dish, although it was lip smacking good.
- Brussel Sprouts were amazing
- Mushroom tarte was amazing, but $12 is way overpriced for this. It's small!
- Flatbread special was one of my favorites, it had a delicate sliced cured meat and gorgonzola cheese. Perfect flavor, and actually a good size portion. 
- Rabbit was OK, more pastry puff than rabbit. Not the best for $14. 
- Lobster & pine nut tortellini was really good, but for $14, you only get 2 tortellinis and they were pretty small. I was shocked at this portion size for the price. Although it was very delicious, my table ordered a second one! 
- DUCK Breast was the best dish for your money. $14 it was hearty, plenty of meat, great sauces, and veggies. We ordered 2 of these it was so good! 
- OCTOPUS was also one of our favorites. Perfectly cooked, great flavor, with fennel. Yumm!
- TROUT was another favorite of mine, it was a thick cut, and cooked perfectly. I really enjoyed this one. 
 
Overall, fantastic food, small portions, but high prices for the portion size. So, come here, its totally worth it, but don't come on an empty stomach or you'll end up spending way too much money to fill yourself up!

The first time we visited this place, we decided to walk to downtown Collingswood around 9pm or so to see if anything was still open for dinner. The restaurant was almost empty, and the staff were obviously cleaning up from the dinner rush and getting ready to close for the night, but they enthusiastically welcomed and served us. I don't think we got out of there until close to 11pm, but there was never a hint that they were trying to hurry us out. In fact, they overheard us whispering that maybe we shouldn't order dessert so that they could go home, they came over and told us not to worry about it. I've been back several times since then, and I've never had a bad experience. Sometimes you have to wait a bit for a reservation on a busy night, but its never been excessive.

I went with two friends, we got the mac and cheese, the burger and the chicken option. Everything was DELICIOUS. I'm usually very against getting the chicken option at restaurants, but I'm glad I did, this was something to write home about.

My only gripe was with the cheese plate. It was really tasty, but a bit overpriced. Not enough to take a star away, but take note of the price before you order so you're not surprised.

Clicking through the website you'll find a chic boutique hotel in walking distance to the hot spots and it is! There are a few issues that put it on my shit list. 

The rooms are beautiful. Modern with thoughtful touches and local art that veers away from any of the bland hotel art. They even have a rotating art gallery downtown which was filled with great pieces. Air condition is on point which is a life saver. While the rooms are clean I did have one major issue - no fitted bed sheet. When I asked the concierge about this she looked at me like she's never in her life heard of a fitted bed sheet and shrugged. Beds are comfortable it's just a bit gross that your bottom sheet can shift and suddenly your laying on the bed which is not washed like the sheets are. Gross. Also our room was next to a club which was blaring music till 2 - since we were not staying in the heart of that action I didn't really anticipate that being a problem. Not the end of the world but if you're staying for business you might want a nice quite room. Outside of the music from across the way you can't hear your neighbors which is a major plus. 

The concierge were not helpful at all. Zip. Nada. You're better off asking a friendly Lyft driver for tips. While the staff outside if much more friendly they managed to send up in the wrong direction and neglect to order a cab for us. Luckily cabs zoom by all the time so it's not a problem.  They had just told us they used ""special cabs they trust that took care of people"" which was a sweet offer - with zero follow through. Lastly, not even a tiny discount on coffee or other goodies? Be that way then - jerks! 

They charge you the full price when you book, so be aware. All and all it's a cute little hotel and you'll have a great time there, it's just your money might be better spent elsewhere that will help you have a smoother trip.",4,jwhlPWehZdLokbvAfddpbA

I was referred to Dr. Muff by my dentist--twice. I kept putting the surgery off because again, no one likes getting work done to their teeth. But it had become serious. I was teething just like my toddler daughter. And just as she would get feverish and catch every bug, I would, too! The ever-opening wound in my mouth was NOT good for my health.

My favorite thing about Dr. Muff is that he never made me feel bad for putting off the surgery. Ok, and that he laughed at my jokes! His bedside manner is superb. I was comfortable and confident from the consultation to the surgery to the follow up to the recovery (aka Netflix & Popsicle marathon).

Dr. Muff also was cool and collected when I announced I did not have health insurance. The office worked out an easy payment plan that worked great for me! His willingness to work with my finances was a major indicator that he really CARED about my oral surgery. He WANTED the best for my health--even if it meant some patience on his part--THAT was refreshing!

The office staff was great. They supported Dr. Muff so he could excel at what he does best--surgery!

Three years ago I had got into a car accident and was having a lot of trouble with back pain. I was going to a local chiropractor but unfortunately I was not able to make it to her because her hours conflicted with my work schedule. So after a few months of suffering The Joint finally opened.

I love that you can walk in any day of the week and get an adjustment without an appointment or any extra fuss like filling out paperwork or participating in any seminars.

Found Saing Thai Cuisine over Yelp and almost every review raved about this restaurant. Needless to say, I was happy to try it out myself. 

Husband and I dined in Thursday evening around 5:30, they weren't busy at all. Similar to my Thai place in Atlanta, nothing super special inside. We sat down and quickly ordered, starting with the hot and sour soup (not notated on menu btw). It was delicious, hot and flavorful. I ordered my Thai regular, drunken noodles with chicken (you can pick whatever protein you want). As we waited for our food, many people came in to pick up takeout orders. For those who dined in, several were greeted with their regular order recited to them, by whom I perceived as the owners, before they rushed off to the kitchen. Very impressive might I say! It made me want to be a regular. 

Our food came out piping hot, just like I like it. You could spot the hot peppers in the drunken noodles immediately, I knew this dish wasn't for the faint of heart! It was extremely spicy, just like I liked it. The sauce had so much flavor and the noodles were generously coated. I didn't eat all of my entree and ended up taking my leftovers home. 

I posted a picture of the husband and my food on my Instagram story and all our friends from Sierra Vista started messaging us asking where we were, they had to visit! Overall, we really enjoyed the service and food and will be back.",0,93TZil6GOtB2FfT9mIbZYQ

We were seated in the very back room where a birthday party was going on, which was very odd to us. There were dozens of tables available in the main dining room, but they seated us in the corner of this occupied and loud room. Extremely inconvenient.

Next, we were greeted by our server, Steve. Immediately we could sense a hostile and irritated attitude from him. We also felt very rushed to make our order. For appetizers we ordered shrimp cocktail, and escargot. Both were amazing. When we asked for more bread for the escargot, Steve abruptly replied, ""I'll have to put in an order for it"", insinuating it would be an extra charge--which we were happy to pay for.  He followed that up with, ""are you going to order yet?""  

We are in our late twenties, and we believe his rude responses were triggered by our age. Perhaps Steve thought that because we look young that it would affect his tip in a negative way. It gets much worse. 

Immediately after we finished our appetizers,  plates were taken away from us that still had food on them; without being asked. Steve then said ""What would you like for dinner?"" (third time we were asked this) the rude, rushed tone continued. We replied saying we had a couple of questions. He was visibly bothered by that. My boyfriend asked what steaks Steve recommended. Steve pointed to two steaks on the menu and did not provide any legitimate feedback about either one of the steaks. Confused by this lack of response, my boyfriend asked him to clarify which steak he preferred between the two and why. Steve then basically said either one was a great steak...again, not answering the question. So, my boyfriend chose a steak without Steve's help, and then asked how he recommend it be cooked. Steve said ""I can't tell you how to eat your meat"". At this point my blood was boiling and I was literally speechless. It continued to get worse. My boyfriend then ordered a salad, and asked if they had a balsamic vinaigrette dressing. Steve sighed and forced his hand towards the menu and pointed to where the list of dressings were, saying they didn't have one. Clearly he was upset that my boyfriend asked a question that he had to point out on the menu. Then, my boyfriend ordered potatoes as a side. Potatoes come as baked, whipped, or French fries. Seeking for helpful input yet again, my boyfriend asked which potato he preferred. With even more of an attitude than before, Steve rolled his eyes, sighed, then let out a sarcastic laugh and said, ""Ha! Uh, ya know...just like your grandma's potatoes"". What? We stared back at him in confusion. This obviously didn't answer our question and we still don't know what the hell ""grandma's potatoes"" are. For the record, we both chose ""whipped"" and they were bland. The only item we had not worth ordering.

My turn. I then ordered Prime Rib, which I usually don't order. So, I too asked him how it should be cooked. I got the same rude response my boyfriend did earlier, saying that he cannot tell me how to eat my meat.

Meanwhile, the table of 2 ladies sitting next to us were stunned and couldn't believe the way he was treating us. They were just as appalled as we were. They said that he was obviously treating our table differently than everyone else around us and they have never witnessed such offensive behavior from a server.

I endured more than I could handle at this point, so I went up to the Hostess and explained that we had an extremely rude, condescending server and I didn't want him to serve us anymore. I was very adamant and clear that I was outraged from his behavior. 

About 15 minutes later, we had a new server. No manager ever stopped by to acknowledge the outrage I expressed after being disrespected in a way that I have NEVER experienced at a restaurant before. No apology from Steve, either. We spent over $200 despite the absolutely horrific experience thanks to Steve. Shame on management for allowing one of their servers to treat customers the way he did. We will NOT come back the next time we visit. If you're willing to pay a lot of money for great food but risk being deliberately disrespected throughout your entire experience, then come here for a meal.",17,lOSonfx7uDNqRqBT1XcNPA

The lounge is separate from the locker room, and the locker room has a few showers with all the fixins, a bomb wet sauna for one or two people if you're lying down, several if you're sitting up. 

Soon as I got ready, Celeste (I'm pretty sure that was her name, she told me twice but I might have forgotten) picked me up in the lounge (where they have a variety of beverages available) and took me to my room. It was HEAVENLY! Smelled amazing still, the bed was HEATED, and the head rest was the most comfortable I've ever experienced, perfectly adjusted so that my neck wouldn't sink down and pinch when she got started. She put a heated bag of rice (I think) I my back to get started, and it was he best start to a massage I've ever had. Oh, but before that I got to choose one of six essential oil mixtures for my massage, and under the head rest they had a bowl of sage and some gorgeous exotic flowers that wafted up nicely during the treatment!

I could go on, but I mainly wanted to shout out Celeste for a fantastic experience, she was incredibly intuitive and adjusted pressure as needed.

They have done a good job in mimicking a British pub without making it seem too fake (a la Vegas).

Extra point for cask beers which change regularly. I had a fantastic Smokehead stout (by Paradox?) which was aged in whiskey barrels giving a distinctive finish and flavor profile. Served only slightly below room temperature, of-course.

As one would expect, the fish n chips seemed popular, but I went for the Sunday roast, which is served after 1pm on Sundays and included an extremely succulent and tender slow (10 hr) cooked prime rib roast beef. Accompanying the roast are a couple whole roasted potatoes and an authentic Yorkshire pudding (think giant popover).

As Laban mentioned in his review, the fries are pretty awesome, as are the scones which are served with homemade jams (Raspberry in our case).

They do serve a variety of loose teas but interestingly, they were running out of the Darjeeling Early Grey when we were there.

Sticky toffee pudding was as good as I had in England.

Only slight complaint was the waiter we had who was in-experienced and slow, a far cry from the super knowledgeable and efficient waitress the table next to us had. Hope they will overcome that soon.

Whenever I think of a restaurant on mass all it comes to mind is bars that have restaurants with one or two special things that they are known for, I must say that I've passed by this restaurant many times and didn't call my attention; I guess the name doesn't tell you a lot about it or probably the outdoor part not calling my attention but if you're reading this and you want a nice fancy dinner in downtown please go inside!

I was there with a group of friends, we made a reservation for 9 people and following CDC guidelines and all we were given sanitizer, asked for face masks and given our own section which was very cozy, with a mid volume music and a screen showing some burning logs inside a chimney everything suited perfect to enjoy ourselves while being able to talk. The restaurant has a great design and with everyone wearing formal clothes makes it even better.

I apologize since I didn't grab quite well our waitress name but she did an awesome job, so thank you mid 30s, 5'5"", blonde girl with eyeglasses. Even though the night was busy you managed to be very patient, got our orders right and our drinks fast; everything was awesome.

Now, getting to the food. I read many yelp reviews about this restaurant and from the most reviewed dishes, I picked the ""Pan Roasted Chilean Sea Bass"". I hesitated for a minute while reading a yelper saying that hers was overcooked but since it was repeated on the pictures it seemed a good choice so I took the risk.

Needless to say this was one of the best fishes I've tried. It was flawless, crispy on the outside (did you guys do it with those little torch lighters?) and the inside was very tender and tasty also the sauce that was around it was excellent.

As a side my gf picked the onion rings and thank god they ran out of them so we get to try the BWI Cauliflower which seemed to be cooked in the oven and placed on top of homemade hummus which was very smooth.

Our wine selection was a Kono - Pinot Noir from New Zealand that we enjoy, smooth with a strawberry taste.

Now my gf choice was the Seafood Pasta which was generous portion of marinara mixed with linguine pasta with shrimp, mussels and asparagus. Very good flavor but I believe adding cherry tomatoes makes it more acidic taste and I rather enjoy a hearty tomatoe sauce.

We were not informed they would not provide house keeping services until the following evening when we returned to no fresh towels etc. I went to front desk and she said we should have received that flyer at check in for COVID-19. I told her we never received it but I would like fresh towels. She only had beach towels to offer. Everyday!
I called to find location of ice machine. She gave me directions to ice machine that was 3 building away near the pool. I made 4 attempts at finding the mystery machine before finding it inside the gated pool area that says not to enter due to COVID. There are no signs, no nothing about ""ice machine"" anywhere.
I ordered a birthday cake that was delivered. I went to pick it up and I asked for 3 forks, and 3 plates. They couldn't help me out. I understand that part but they seem proud of the fact they could not help me out. Terrible customer service on every level!!
I did like the location. The grounds are historic with a monument detailing the site.

I didn't do it many many years of using library system. I never check all pages in all books in the library. It's a very time-consuming task, because we take a lot of book. We didn't use this book even, because we forgot about it. The book has been lost between our own books on the shelves. When I checked my account online I noticed that I have this book out. I found it on our bookshelf and returned as was. Over time I received a notification from collectors, checked my account online and found $36 fees for this book ($20 to replace the book + $5 processing fee + $10 for collector's fee). They put me into collections without any reduction notice from the library. The same situation as Jaime T. mentioned in her review. If two people have the same case - it could be a truth. I went there and asked ""why?"". Because they found marks from pen on the couple pages. I asked to solve this problem 50/50. Because I know that we didn't open this book. For me it means that we didn't mark inside the book. They told me: ""We always check all books"". Ok. ""I always didn't check all books and it's the first time for many many years of using library and reading many many books with my kids. There is a strong respect to books in our house. Why I have to believe that they always very carefully check all pages in all books, but they could not believe me that we didn't do it? I have NO ONE record about spoiling books for all years. I hoped for some solution as 50/50. Finally, they generously allowed me to buy absolutely new book in some store with the same ISBN number to replace. In additional I still have to pay $15 more: $5 library processing fee (they need to stick a new sticker on that new book and it costs $5) + $10 collector's fee (they are very hurry up to do it with their customer, as I understood from reviews online). Unfortunately, I have no wishes to go any library after this situation. We will buy own books (it could be maybe cheaper) or use application for reading. I am sorry that this kind of library service discourages from using libraries essentially. If some people didn't have some troubles with this library it looks a great.

The Palabok is very tasty! They put just the right amount of sauce for the amount of noodles!

The Tapsilog is also good. The only problem we found was, some of the meat had a lot of flavor, and the other pieces of meat didn't have enough flavor. I think if they were to marinade it evenly, it would be perfect.

However, I'll give it props for being a good meat and three place, but these types of restaurants are not my cup of tea (unless it's at breakfast). 

Monell's is family style, so you don't order what you want off a menu, they bring you bowls and bowls of food that gets passed around and you then spoon out what you want. They change up their menu each day of the week but always have fried chicken which is lightly battered and has a good flavor. 

I went with a group today, and they had the fudge pie already sitting on our plates along with coleslaw and a black eyed pea salad that was probably my favorite item of the meal. They set out pitchers of sweet and unsweet tea and lemonade (wish they would give us water). They also have great biscuits and cornbread that they bring out almost immediately. 

The peach preserves were SUPER sweet; too much for me. Today the specials were the vegetable lasagna (tons of cheese) and a pot roast that was very soggy and seemed more like pulled pork. They also passed around turnip greens, corn pudding, broccoli salad, green beans, mashed potatoes, and turkey stuffing. It's SO much food that you really have to put small portions on your plate and it's still full. It's all very Southern and greasy, so I only come here once every couple of months.

Approaching their 1st ""birthday"", the U (as I call it) has efficiently evolved into everything we hoped it would. Were there some duds along the way? Sure - every new restaurant needs to feel things out and let their customers judge what should stay, and what should go. But we've watched the management and kitchen staff listen to feedback and in turn tweak certain dishes, introduce new ones for the changing seasons, and even get rid of the aforementioned ""duds"". Don't be afraid to speak up if you ever have a question or complaint - they actually do listen.

Despite being a total meat eater - the Veggie burger is by far one of the biggest hits on the menu. Made fresh - not in that 'perfectly round out of a box' shape like you'll find at other places, I literally could eat this every time I'm there (and sometimes it feels like I do). The fresh baked pretzels and cheese sauce (which is like crack) now has a sharp slammin' mustard as an alternative dip. Definitely check out the specials while you're there - there's a reason they call them ""specials"".

Maybe even more so than the food and beer at Ulysses to enjoy is the staff. If you're going to make a place your hangout, take the time to actually meet the people. 

All in all, Ulysses has taken the North Wilmington area to a new level, and I wish them all the same success in the coming years. If you had any doubts and are tired of the same old ""big box"" restaurants, this is the place to go.",3,bBH43V9UWCZwp_dXPrGiJg

I was like wow I'd definitely drive to New Brunswick to try this place. So, I went to bookmark the NJ location and to my surprise find there is a location in Philly!!!! I could not believe I'd never seen or heard of this place when I've frequented many of the other establishments on this block. Just a lil backstory to show how excited I was to come here.

Anyway, my boyfriend and I were in the mood for something casual on a weeknight. Perfect opportunity for some dogs. The first-floor space is pretty large, with a lot of different seating areas (bar, high tops, regular tables, and then the game area). We started with the punch and a Moscow mule. The punch was not overly-sweet as I anticipated a punch might be. Very well-balanced as our server described it would be. My mule was great! I often order mules, and this classic was tasty and done very well. 

The menu is HUGE, we were definitely a little overwhelmed at first. We started with the deviled eggs ($3), which come 4 to an order. A great little app to start the meal. We were in the mood to really stuff our faces so we got the Trenton Thunder, Mighty Duck, Conquistadog, and the Bun Mi. We each got a small side of chips, which we loved and just wished we had more of. I tried all but the Trenton Thunder (my bf's favorite so it was gone before I had the chance). Having looked at the menu before, I knew I was going to get the Bun Mi. I am OBSESSED with bahn mi, so I was super hype for it. I was definitely a little disappointed with this one. The cantonese sausage had amazing flavor, but I didn't think the traditional bahn mi flavors came through enough, especially with regard to the pickled veggies. It was by no means bad, I just thought it fell a little flat. I really enjoyed the other dogs so I wouldn't order the Bun Mi again. The Mighty Duck was my favorite. The hoisin sauce packed a real punch and I loved the duck flavor. The Conquistadog was also very good, but could use more potatoes. The flavors brought me back to my time spent in Madrid. It was my first time here so I definitely wanted to try as many dogs as possible. However, I think normally I would have only ordered one dog and been full and satisfied. 

My only real complaint was that the sausages/dogs themselves were not very hot. It did not seem as if they were grilled to order or anything, just heated until warm. We still enjoyed all the food so it was not a big deal and did not affect the quality, just something worth noting.

My boyfriend ordered a refill on his punch, and it took a pretty long time. They brought it when we were already done with our meals and said it would be comped. No harm, no foul. We definitely appreciated that!

My review may not read like a 5 star review, but even with my minor complaints, I'm still giving this place 5 stars. We loved our drinks, the food, and the atmosphere. The food service was quick, and our server was nice. It was the perfect setting for a fun and casual date night. We thought everything was well-priced, and liked that they had dogs ranging from 6 to 12 dollars. This seems like a great and unique place to bring friends visiting from out of town. From classic to super different, out-of-the-box creations, there's something for everyone on the menu (limited options for vegetarians obviously). We will definitely be back!",2,Zx9QQe2Fgw_2kbL7qBV7tQ

I was hesitant to come because the reviews to this place are so all over the place, and well the $$$ didn't help. The hubster and I finally made it during a weeknight to get a bite before doing some xmas shopping and I was surprised how packed it was at the bar! I don't know if they have a slamming happy hour or something, but people were really pouring in around 6 pm.

As for the place itself, it has no windows, which I absolutely hate. Even though it is located in a strip plaza, next to a laundromat, I want windows. Inside it is a nice old looking Italian restaurant, a bit romantic, a bit outdated, and mostly full of a much older crowd (55+). Thankfully I didn't come to hook up, I just came to eat. 

I ordered a penne vodka with grilled chicken (the chicken was extra, $5ish), bringing the plate to about $17ish. I say all this because normally in Italian places I don't mind paying more bc I know I'm going to get leftovers for lunch. Well, this place serves pretty adequate portions and thus no leftovers really. I was really disappointed with the lack of sauce on my plate, and well, the lack of flavor. The chicken was amazing, really amazing, thus making the pasta situation even more devastating.

My husband ordered the chicken alfredo (which was oddly not on the menu - there was no mention of alfredo sauce or any cream sauce at all on any of the plates) and was equally not satisfied. The man had to put about 3 tablespoons of pepper and salt to get the pasta to taste decent. He had the fried chicken cutlet and it tasted like it was one those frozen patties. 

Our waiter forgot about us after our entrees arrived, I assume because they were understaffed for the bar area, but I was still really annoyed how long it took him to bring us our bill (over 20 minutes). This is not a place I would return to.",6,TR7ezcRznfr1Jif7euZZJg

That said, I've only had routine/pre-scheduled appointments, so I can't speak to scheduling appointments that come up suddenly. 

Unfortunately, the billing process has been terrible. My preventive visits have consistently been coded using non-preventive CPT codes, which means my insurance will not cover them. I've requested reviews and recodes, but to no avail. I've been in absurd phone calls where my insurance agent, the Sansum agent, and I all agree that the visit was preventive, but Sansum still refuses to use a preventive code. I've been promised a recode, and then told a month later that ""nevermind, we won't recode it."" It's all the weirder because Sansum will get their money anyways, either from my insurance or from me.

Which according to advertisers the room should be high floor with a slightly bigger room with separate relaxation cove. Also we were looking forward to private bar on 25th floor for some dinner cocktails as website states. Checking in was painful. Lines were extremely long. Employee was nice but I could tell I wasn't getting the room I reserved. When I said I specifically bought the concierge floor because wife and I like relaxing with not so many people around she rearranged something and said I should be good now. Went to my room 26th floor and it was old room and small not what picture looked like. We go to the special bar to find out its only open from 7-11 am. We'll check in is at 4 so that bar does us no good whatsoever. I asked to get a credit or move me to correct room wasn't happy paying $350 after resort fees for that old room with no bar.  Of course front desk couldn't help so she got TaHa a manager from back. He explained everything and we came to an agreement to put me in new wing with at least updated room. TaHa was very professional and honestly turned what could of been a bad start to the trip into salvaging the night. I appreciate him listening and addressing my concerns. We came to an agreement the old fashioned way and met in the middle and shook hands each of us satisfied. Hotel overall was nice we usually go to Peppermill but was sold out. Charlie Palmers was fabulous best meal I've had since I can remember. King Crab and Prime Ribeye with Whitehall Lane Cab Mac and cheese and whipped potatoes. Omg delicious! Highly recommend.

Mind you the restaurant opened at 5:00 and was nearly empty, so how they ran out is a mystery.  The two guys re-ordered something else.  Five minutes later, the waiter returned to say that they were out of whatever my husband re-ordered. 

Waited a little too long for salads to arrive but they looked good.  Unfortunately, my friend found herself chewing on a piece of paper towel in her salad, and a minute later I got the same 'treat' in mine.  The waiter took them all away and we said we didn't want more.

Meal finally came and was decent.  Portions were average.  Wanted to order additional glasses of wine but waiter nowhere to be found.  

Finally, as we finished our meals, the manager came over and said he was told there were some ""issues"" with our meals.  We explained the above, emphasizing that we were all pulling for the restaurant to make it because we're residents of Newtown, but the experience was unacceptable thus far.  He offered to comp us desserts, but we were having dessert at home so politely declined.  He sent them out anyway, forcing us to make a choice to eat them, box them, or waste the food.  We chose to eat them.

At the very least, he should have comped us our drinks, or taken a portion off the bill, but simply serving us desserts we said we didn't want didn't leave a good taste in our mouth for returning anytime soon, if ever.",6,zJWAEvkK668yVuU2KA-1ow

In the review, I admitted that after getting a pedi, I got a nail fungus. So gross! So embarrassing! And worse, I couldn't get a pedicure for almost a year while my nail grew out. As there are so many wonderful reviews of The Nail Loft on Yelp, I wondered if it was possible that I picked up the fungus somewhere else. That in mind, I decided to give them another chance. 

I got a mani/pedi combo. After the girl next to me finished her pedicure, I noticed that they immediately put someone in the same chair. I thought, ""That's weird"". I hadn't noticed them cleaning the bowl nor do they use plastic liners. But again I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Perhaps they cleaned it swiftly when I wasn't looking? (I later learned that even a swift clean is not sufficient. Google it for yourself.) When they moved me from the pedicure chair to the manicure table, I decided to pay close attention. I watched my old chair like a hawk. And sure enough, they placed someone at my old chair without cleaning the bowl. 

They create a beautiful nail. I've had both good and bad service. The salon is cute. BUT!!! I can't get past the fact that they don't clean their chairs between clients. That's gross and dangerous.",11,4af7IWHRc890BUKcAGlyLQ

The space is large and the brewery and taproom is nicely decorated.  The bar area surrounds the brewing vats which makes for some cool photo opportunities.

I arrived early on a Friday evening and the outdoor and in door seating was pretty packed.  I got lucky and found a seat at the bar.  As they have a large amount of beers on tap, it took me a while to figure out my order.  The service there is great and I was asked at least three times in five minutes if I was ready to order.  The service was that attentive until closer to 10pm when the servers were much less attentive.

I started with an order of Chicharrones which was a large portion for an appetizer and absolutely delicious.  The portions could easily feed two or three and it was the perfect compliment to a night of beer tasting. 

THE BEERS:

Fancy Paper... Hazy IPA 6.5% ABV... this hazy IPA has the right kind of everything a hazy IPA should have, juicy, citrus, delicious!

White Oak Jai Alai IPA 7.5% ABV... WOW... that white oak transforms this IPA into something MAGICAL.. this is FIRE!!!!!

Space Pope... American IPA 7.3% ABV... this is a decent IPA

The Bendwood... Hazy DIPA 8% ABV... kinda juicy, strong and delicious... this is a Hollywood Star IPA!

Old Blazes... Belgian strong ale 7.9% ABV... Everything you would expect from a Belgian. Delish 

Slap Hitter... Cream Ale 4.7% ABV ... nothing special, not my palate 

Improvisacion... Rye Indian Brown Ale 6.6% ABV... Can't  easily describe this one.  English rye ale, smokey with an IPA finish.  Can't make this Sh@t up... It actually works.  It was very good.

Tam O'Shanter... Strong Scotch Ale 6.4% ABV... this is a well balanced English style ale

I was very impressed by Cigar City's beer offerings.  Other than the Slap Hitter, everything I tried was very good.  I didn't rate the Jai Alai, Florida Cracker, Maduro Brown Ale, Florida Man, or Guayabera because I have had all of these many times over the years. All are consistently fantastic.  

I was surprised not only with quality of the Beer offerings at Cigar City, but also by the consistency and overall balance of all the beers.  I have been to too many breweries where you can tell the brewers are brewing for themselves. The brewers here are brewing for the public and are doing an exceptional job.  KUDOS...

If you are in Tampa and want great food and exceptional beer, I recommend Cigar City Brewing.  In West Tampa it is definitely off the beaten path. You can't go wrong with the fantastic beer, food and service.",4,WroWA_0PNRecLHhWdlxpnw

If I could give them no stars, I absolutely would.

My new car got scratched up on the hood a few months after I purchased it, so I searched for places to take it in the Indianapolis area. I just moved here and haven't dealt with any car places in the Indy area, but this place looked decent to me, so I scheduled an estimate. It was a simple 3 day job, and I dropped my car off Monday night- they said it would be available to pick up Thursday morning. I made sure to tell them that I needed my car by Thursday evening, they said it should be no problem. 
I called Thursday morning to ask when it would be available- they said it wouldn't be. I called Friday morning and they said to call back later- well it turns out that they said it definitely would not be ready until after the weekend, and I could pick it up Monday. Well now it is Monday and they STILL don't know if it will be done by the end of today.

This place just DOES NOT know what they are doing. My car was NOT heavily damaged at all, it was only scratched, no dents, and they couldn't even handle a small paint job. The fact that I had to keep calling and calling every single day to check up on my car was a huge pain, and they never seemed to know what was going on.  Every time I called in they had to put me on hold for extended periods of time just to go back and check on my car, even if I had called a few hours prior. If they don't know, they'll just keep telling you to ""call back later"", instead of checking it themselves and calling you back. I even asked the woman on the phone if she could call me back instead. She said she would go check and call me right back, but she never did.

I would never recommend this company to anyone, ever. I can't wait for this process to be over and done with and I hope they did a good job on the work otherwise I will be taking it someplace else just to get my car out of their care.",3,QVTcZ59l7bXeR5C59EQo_g

The restaurant was warmly lit and decorated with golden-framed paintings which made for a very rustic, old-school Italian vibe. Every staff member we encountered was friendly, accommodating, and professional. Overall the ambiance was cozy and felt like family dinner at my parents' house, but without the poorly concealed animosity and naive arguments about politics.

The wine was awful, but keep in mind it's a BYO so it was our own bottle of cheap merlot that was two-thirds full and had been opened over a week ago. Fun fact- if you're a fully functioning adult and bring an unopened bottle of wine that is not twist-off, they do not have a corking fee! 

Ok, the food: The eggplant rollatini was everything I was looking for in a first-course. It's essentially an eggplant lasagna roll-up with a perfectly executed cheese to sauce ratio. It was really hard not to lick the plate after, but I managed to restrain myself because my friend said he would leave if I did that and I'm not self-confident enough to dine out alone.

Next, the three pastas. The gnocchi and the ravioli were FLAWLESS. Gnocchi was delicate, soft, and melted in my mouth. The sauce on both gnocchi and ravioli was rich, buttery, and delish. Penne wasn't my fave, but I'm not a big marinara sauce person so it was probably just a matter of taste. 

Unfortunately as with many of my life decisions, I made the wrong choice when it came to the entrée. It was really hard to decide between the varying options of veal, shrimp, and fish dishes, but I ultimately went with the Veal Carciofi: veal, artichoke, cherry tomatoes, and shrimp. It tasted better than it looked (see photo), but I think I should have done the shrimp risotto, which is what my friend ordered. The patrons next to us (we couldn't tell if they were mother/son or cougar/poolboy) happened to order the same entrees as we did, so I assume these are popular dishes. 

For dessert, I had the tartufo, which is basically Italy's answer to mochi- a little vanilla ice cream ball coated with chocolate chip sprinkles. As tasty as it was adorable. 

TLDR; this isn't the most incredible Italian restaurant I've been to, but I would definitely come back for the gnocchi and the good vibes.

Let's start with the COVID-19 protocols. We chose this spot in hopes of socially distant outdoor seating. All they've done is cram a bunch of picnic tables inside an inclosed tent with no cross draft or circulation of air. 

They've moved to disposable utensils, plates, cups, etc. While this cheapens the experience, it was the service and food quality that really knocked down the star rating. The server never offered water. They brought a cup of coffee when we ordered it, but never refilled the coffee and never offered other beverages. I didn't have a drink for any portion of my meal. 

The food was delivered cold. Probably had to do with the paper plates. The portion of ""2 eggs"" in my breakfast were the size of a six egg omelette. If they had used any seasoning it probably would have tasted good. The grits were cold and congealed. The sausage was cold. The biscuit basket was great. I'd recommend the biscuits. Of course, you can only eat so many biscuits without a drink to wash it down...did I mention they didn't bring water?

My wife ordered Brussels sprouts hash. It looked really good on the menu, but when it arrived we learned that the menu ingredient ""potatoes"" actually meant canned yams tossed with Brussels sprouts and peppers. It tasted bad and the ingredients were misrepresented on the menu.

My dog was not provided water or adequately monitored and then needed to go to the vet because she had an infection, a fever, and could not walk. The total bill for the vet was $371. My dog should have had doggy day care on both days of her stay and is promised to be let out 4 times a day. With these services my dog's injury should have been noticed by a staff member. I tried to call to resolve this issue with a manager and the only time I got ahold of her she asked permission to call my vet and now will not return my phone calls. When I had talked to the manager about my concerns, she lied multiple times about my conversations with staff when dropping my dog off or picking her up to take blame away from where blame is due- the lack of monitoring that occurs while your pet is in their care.

This is what happened: when my dog was handed back to us we were told she had been snoozing in her suite and we sat down in the lobby to wait for the self-service bath. When we got her, she immediately drank the entire container of water in the lobby and my fiancé made mention of when she had water last. I noticed her front paws were red and asked the woman working behind the counter and she said she didn't know what happened and there were no notes in her chart about it. She went and asked the person working in the suite area and they also hadn't noticed but said sometimes dogs chew their paws when bored or anxious. Again, with the day care and walks she was promised someone should have noticed my dog was injured. After getting home she drank another entire bowl of water and ate more than two cups of food immediately like she was starving and then laid down. 

When it was time for her to go out before bed my dog would not get up. I stood her up and she screamed in pain and laid back down. My fiancé asked what had happened and we tried to get her up a second time and again she howled but stood up shaking. Then I noticed she wasn't putting any pressure on one of her front paws and was trying really hard to not put any on her other front paw. The next morning, she still would not stand up and was very lethargic. We could coax her into taking a few steps, but she would stop to lick her paws and lay back down immediately. I went to the store and got her some paw soother to see if that helped her feel any better and left a message at Good Dog to call me back. At this point I unpacked her bag from Good Dog and saw that 3/4 of the chews I had provided them to alleviate her boredom were still in her bag. The soother seemed to help her feel a little better but the next morning she was not standing up again so I called her vet and they said she could come in as a drop off. I also called Good Dog who didn't have a manager on duty. Before speaking to the manager my vet got back to me and said Kira had an infection in her paws, a fever and was abnormally lethargic. The manager had no explanation for why my dog was so thirsty or why I still had her chews. Then she said she had been in the lobby at our pick-up and she knew THEY had told us about her paws. As I stated earlier, they had NO idea there was something wrong with her. This led me to asking if she had gotten play time and her four potty breaks why no one would have noticed. The manager responded she had just come from play time when I picked her up, and again this was a lie that I refuted because I had been told she was snoozing in her suite when I got there. Then this woman tried to tell me I had informed them at her drop off that this was a problem my dog normally had which is absolutely not true. My dog has never done this before, and she asked to call my vet to confirm this. I gave her permission and she never called. I've called Good Dog two more times and the manager will not respond- they know they are in the wrong and do not want to take responsibility. If you want your pet to be monitored and cared for do not take them to Good Dog.",4,R5PW8g_fBsBflVJtH64Wvg

As a working adult with a disability, I greatly admire the Goodwill mission and appreciate that most of the time when you enter a Goodwill Store you're going to see people with disabilities working. 

However, I also can't deny that I'm frequently troubled by the Goodwill retail experience. If you're training people to enter the workforce, then it seems a reasonable expectation that you train them to do the job well and professionally and in a friendly manner. Otherwise, you're simply setting them up to fail and/or ensuring they'll always be stuck in low-end paying jobs. Quite reasonably, most people with disabilities are not going to give up the security of life on disability for a low-wage paying job. 

To be fair, across the organization, things have improved. Kiosks set-up for applicants have become more accessible (though far from perfectly accessible) and interior lay-outs have become increasingly accessible. Employees are, in fact, becoming more friendly. 

It's also potentially unfair to judge a Goodwill on the basis of its busiest day of the month - the monthly 50% Saturday that arrives on the first Saturday of the month. 

It's chaos. 

As you pull up to this location in Fishers, you immediately notice their rather large parking lot. In fact, my immediate thought was that the place seemed surprisingly not that busy. The more I looked, however, the more I realized the parking lot is simply rather huge. They were quite busy.

This Goodwill features some of the basics that are common at most locations - accessible parking is fairly plentiful, curb cuts are ADA compliant, and they do have automatic doors (which is not true of all locations, but seems to be standard with each new location opened). 

The store was crowded, but I also noticed the clientele seemed friendlier here. While there was chaos, it seemed more controlled than many locations during this monthly sale. I am still getting used to mobility after my recent limb loss - so, I'm a little more bumpy than usual and people were mostly cool with my near misses and generally bad wheeling. The store layout is fairly similar to most - books to the right as you enter followed by rows of clothing and most housewares, etc. toward the back. They have dressing rooms, including an accessible one. 

The lines were fairly long, though they went fairly smoothly. I found it weird that they seemed to have 2 different lines with no clear division at the registers. In my neighborhood, that would cause fights. In this neighborhood, people seemed fairly courteous. 

Employees were friendly if not particularly outgoing. I did like the fact that in my line the cashier was obviously training someone and was doing so quite nicely with solid instructions. 

I was able to find clothing in my sizes, sometimes difficult, as I'm a bulky guy with a curved spine who sits in a wheelchair. At some locations, it almost feels like they put away the nice stuff on this particular day but I didn't get that sense here. 

Overall, I would consider to experience to be ""just fine."" This was neither the best Goodwill in Central Indiana nor anywhere near the worst. I'd easily return when in the area. However, it was plagued by the usual Goodwill issues - poorly labeled clothing (EXAMPLE - one shirt I picked up was labeled as a XXL, yet the label on the item clearly said 16 1/2 which is not even an XL). The employees seemed to all be working, though I also seem to always have issues with oblivious employees - employees who block aisles because they have work to do and can't be bothered to move for actual paying customers. 

However, for the most part this was a solid experience - I was in/out with my friend in a surprisingly short amount of time for this particular day and was able to get on my way to our next stop. 

PS: I just have to get this off my chest. Nearly every Goodwill posts large photos on their walls of individuals I'm assuming are either employees (past or present) or people who've gone through their programs - I understand this concept, but have to admit that some of these photos just strike me as incredibly disrespectful. They're just not well done photos. Can't you find a photographer who will donate some time to create some quality photos? If these people are working hard to enter the workforce, they deserve to be treated with dignity and respect. 

Okay, I'm off my soapbox now.",5,A9cXP_K95FRor1qxuUEu2g

Settled for a couple small combination shaved ices ($6.00). My wife got The Alota Colada which is Banana, Strawberry and Pina Colada flavors with Coconut Ice Cream and a Sno-Cap (sweetened condensed milk). I ordered the Kona Sunset which is Guava, Passion Fruit and Mango with the addition of Coconut Ice Cream, Coconut Flakes and a Sno-Cap. 

Huge amount of shaved ice for the price. Gotta say all the flavors were really good but we both didn't care for the Coconut Ice Cream. It had a off flavor we both couldn't put our fingers on it. I will definitely ask for more Sno-Cap next time.

When you look for a big box home improvement store in St. Charles, these are the two behemoths you end up choosing between. While each location provides you with a myriad of employee attitudes and knowledge levels, you can always count on wandering around looking for what you need far longer than it takes to pick it out when you finally get there. That aside, here is my opinion:

1) Lowe's has a better tool section.
2) Lowe's has a better overall layout.
3) Lowe's has a better kitchen area/appliance area.
4) Lowe's has had better customer service most of the time.
5) Lowe's has a better grill and outdoor equipment selection.
6) Lowe's has a better generator selection.

While on the other hand:

1) The Home Depot usually has slightly better pricing.
2) The Home Depot has a better selection of fencing, fans and exterior lighting.
3) The Home Depot has had better wood 5 out of 9 times so far.
4) The Home Depot has a better softener salt selection/availability.
5) The Home Depot has a better outdoors section.

Now these are my opinions firsthand. I always go to both before I purchase at whichever one I think is better for that particular reason.

I will continue to play home improvement ping pong always looking for the better of deals.

 Yep. She kicked us out in the 36 degree weather and invited us to go down the street.
 While we were standing out front in the cold, looking through the window at the two empty seats at the bar, a cab driver pulled into the valet lane and picked up a fare from the restaurant.

First, HOW STUPID DO YOU HAVE TO BE TO WORK AT THIS PIZZA HUT?  Let me state that I tried ordering from Pizza Hut in Edwardsville.  I tried to  call a few times.  Didn't figure out that they're phones must be down until after a few tries.  My phone calls kept getting routed to a national call center.  Pizza Hut cannot venture into unchartered waters.  Their call center was an absolute joke with extremely poor customer service or none I should say.  People couldn't fill in the blanks and take an order for their life.  I was asked my information to be repeated 4 times for every thing.  I spent (call me stupid) 45 mins trying to order a pizza on two seperate occasions.  I was told that oh we're sick, oh we're new, and we do not take orders for your city.  We do not deliver to you.  Ok well yah you do take orders from my city, and yes you do deliver to me.  However, as I had stated 4 times I want to pick it up from Edwardsville.  Not only could they not take my order correctly, they could not route my order to the correct PH even after I offered to give them the phone number and address of the store myself.  I could not order online cause the order wouldn't go through either.  Which leads me to this sorry excuse for a restaurant.  I told them the story very politely asked if they could take my order down correctly get it completed etc.  I even confirmed I was talking to an actual person at the store myself.   After she thanked me for not yelling at her like all the other people trying to get PH on a Saturday night, she took my order confirmed the cost etc.  I then called back to ensure what time it would be completed since she did not tell me before I hung up.  When I show up it had been over an hour trying to get a pizza.  The store looked a lil dirty, there was no one making, baking, or deliverying pizzas.  There was one table in the entire store.  I walk up and the girl has lost my ticket did not knwo where my order was and left for 10 mins before returning with a loser.  No manager on duty..  The lose my order and refuse to comp me anything and explain I'll have to wait another 30mins for  my order.  I say give me your managers name where they say no.  And I'm like ok stupid I can read your name tag.  I'll write your name down my self d@v!d B (stupid did you graduate school?) cause I can read.  They then give me a number to call and complain without any remorse of losing my order and making the night worse..  It's now been 1.5 hrs trying to get a pizza.  They give me an 800# that is a survey number and you require all your ticket info in order to complete.  You cannot speak with a person!  WTF.  So I call back to Eville get the call center all over again, tell my story.  It gets better.  They completely agree I should get free pizza's but no manager is answering their phones or on duty to give me my free info.  Want more?  The call center dude cannot give me the direct 800# to call back and avoid a survey or knows his number to call back and see what PH is going to do about this EXTREMELY HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE.  They  have my phone numbers and email.  I still have yet to get a reply.

The very first day I moved into these apartments they assigned me a parking spot that was already taken....I proceeded to park there (not knowing it was taken) and came back to my vehicle vandalized, a guy had written all over my windows with sharpie ""this isn't your spot"" went to the office and they helped me get it off and told me ""he's done this before"" so basically what you're telling me is you guys are okay with him vandalizing vehicles. I've lived here for half a year and boy I can't wait till my lease is up in January so I can leave! I live below probably one of the most inconsiderate people. I work at 4am in the morning, have 2 jobs and can't get sleep because she comes home around 11pm and slams doors, blasts her music and bangs on the walls for whatever reason. She gets into verbal fights with her boyfriend and me and my husband can hear her screaming at him. We've had to call the police out here 3 times now. We've reported it to the office but they say they can't do anything about it, so the noise continues. She started calming down but now she's at it again and I feel like there's no point in reporting to the office. She's come down to our door and harassed us while she was drunk and yelled in our faces and we reported that as well and still nothing done. We've had to deal with being harassed because some girl parked in our spot and claimed it wasn't ours even though I showed her right on my portal the spot number that I'm paying for. Reported it to the office and surprisingly that issue was resolved. I've gotten in touch with an attorney and we're talking and he's helping me out with my situation so hopefully if all goes smoothly I can get out of this place before January! Or take this to small claims court and get my money back. I have everything documented and written from each time. I don't feel comfortable in my own home that I pay a ridiculous amount for a one bedroom, almost $1200 for a janky one bedroom one bathroom where something is always breaking. Forgot to mention that I submitted a service request to replace a kitchen light that went out that would probably take 5 minutes to replace and I submitted my service request 7 days ago and haven't heard anything and nobody has shown up to fix it. I talked with the office and they said that I'm going to have to wait another 3 days, so that would be 8 days that I've waited for a simple light bulb change. Rest assured I will not renew my lease here and I will make sure that if anyone ever asks me about these apartments that I tell them everything that anyone here has put up with in the reviews. The only some what good thing about here is that some of the staff are nice, but that's how they get ya. See through the bullshit, don't live at crappy overpriced apartments where they renovate for using cheap things for probably under $500 and charge you out the ass. When you pay rent online they make you pay an extra $33 for THEIR convenience. Save yourself the money and the inconvenience and get a place at the Circ. That's where me and my husband will be going next. Lived at the circ for 4 years and never had any problems.

The food is really good and I would have given 5* rating except 1) it's a little salty for my taste and 2) the salsa is mild, smooth and tastes quite strongly of black pepper. Otherwise, it's a very good option for Mexican food and I am happy to go there for fajitas.

Most dishes are very reasonably priced and it is one of the few restaurants which stays open beyond 8pm!! A HUGE plus for anyone under 80 years of age who wants to have a social life!!

I work up the street from here and walked by during the lunch hour. It's so nice inside! 
The outside is deceiving to how lovely it is inside! 

I went here on a first date (hence the no photos). 

I asked to switch tables so we had the cozy window spot, which was a good move. The place gets packed! It was a Monday night! I was glad I had a reservation. 

Servers were young and friendly and rattled off those specials like Dr Dre rattles his raps. 

The server brought bread in a basket- but it was lined with a piece of paper (like you'd see at nifty fifties)- it didn't fit in with the elegant theme of the restaurant at all. 

And the glass at my dates side of the table had lipstick on it.. someone else's. So they promptly poured our wine (carefully) into a new glass. 

Our appetizer was the beet salad- the goat cheese makes this a light yet satisfying appetizer. 

My dinner was the GF Vincenzo- holy moly I am drooling thinking about it! The melted cheese and perfectly sautéed veggies complemented the chicken cutlets so well. And the risotto is top notch, indeed. 

My date got the Roberto- which she said she also liked very much! 

For all of that it was about $50- we brought the wine so it was an affordable yet classy and elegant first date!

And I think that's awesome. There, I sounded like a weirdo, but whatever. I'm not sure if that's a statement on the sanitation conditions of the city, or its people, or if it's just something they wanted to try out.

I came here last week, and it is considerably smaller than I'm used to (which is the Atlanta Airport). It was quick to get in, quick to go through the lines, and a pretty unfrivolous place. It was easy to find my gate, too. There was free WiFi which was fast.

There's also a $2 shuttle bus to and from the airport, though this was SO hard for me to find, as an out-of-towner. Apparently no one in New Orleans uses it, so they don't know where it is. I was actually starting to get worried about missing my flight, though that really wasn't an issue since the lines were so small there. It's not a normal bus stop, that you can take at any stop, and it took me the better part of 45 minutes to find. For reference, it's the E2 Jefferson bus. I took the Loyola/Tulane bus, with my exact change. It's across from a large pink building, on the right side of the street down from a coffee shop (that's about two block down the street). Shout out to the lady who came out and helped me when she saw how confused I was! It was really sweet of her to do that during her shift.

And another thing to note that could be very important (taken from their website):
Please Note: The E-2 Airport route travels to the intersection of Tulane Avenue and Loyola Avenue (The New Orleans CBD) until 6:52 PM on weekdays. On weekends the E-2 Airport route only travels to the Parish line at the intersection of Tulane Avenue and Carrollton Avenue in Mid-City New Orleans. From this intersection riders must take an RTA route further into New Orleans on weekends.

PROS:
Small, easy to find your way around to your gate.
Bathrooms have sanitizing covers (LOL).
Free WiFi, that was easily accessible (next to the bathrooms).
There's a bus that takes you directly there.
I got through the lines pretty quickly, and had plenty of time to spare.


CONS:
Not a lot of food options (though this didn't bother me, as I had pre-prepared food).
The proper bus stop is REALLY hard to find, if you're out of town.",3,e8Lfi7Km12QbcQFGWzuo1w

The menu here doesn't say ""hash slightly yellow on one side.""  The menu says hash browns.  But the concept of ""browning"" food is completely lost on whoever it is working in the kitchen. They weren't even approaching orange, they were barely yellow, in part, on one side, of a big 1"" thick lump. 

The food placement on the plate was even suspect, my eggs were under my country fried steak, as was my hash yellows.  The country fried steak was clearly the highlight on the plate, but it was tasteless as if it was cooked (almost burnt)  from frozen the night before, and just warmed up a bit and dropped on the plate.

The waitress was friendly at first, but... Only checked on us once, at the only moment I had food in my mouth during the whole visit, at which point my mom (who has dementia) declared ""it's just wonderful.""

The check came before I got a second glass of water. 

I was unaware how badly someone could screw up something as simple as toast. But, now I've learned. First, slice it to thick so that there is a extra high ratio of bread that actually won't be toasted. Then toast it in a device that somehow manages to leave 1/2 of the surface randomly unexposed to any heat.

Out of all the items I tried, I recommend the cheese and steak quesadilla. The bam bam burger was farrrr too rich, the overly sweet meat was drowning in a fat laden cheese and spicy mayo blanket. The yakisoba noodles were cooked perfectly but the seasoning combo just didn't work for me. Finally I'd just straight up say stay away from the tacos- there was nothing to them.

We started with the shortrib flatbread, this must be a keeper on their menu, it was that good with blue cheese, shredded short rib and field greens- yummy. Next I had their filet mignon wrapped bacon with mushroom risotto , also a winner. Many restaurants do this item but this restaurant does it right. My bacon was crispy and the filet mignon perfectly done , my mistake was that I asked for medium , it should have medium rare, but that was my error not the restaurants. We finished with the apple bread pudding which was good however the bread pudding was dense . I would recommend changing the way serve it like placing it on a dish with the bread pudding  at the bottom and having the ice cream on top so it can drizzle it and get all soft and goey as it melts. Also the egg nog creme brûlée was a nice twist on a classic, also a must try. The only negative to this place was decor.

I started with a cup of mushroom soup . It had a very strong pepper taste to it ,which I did not like very much.

Next was a side of Mac & Cheese. It comes in a pretty big bowl  with a nice topping of bread crumbs and slivered cheese . Very tasty , and I enjoyed the light crunch that the bread crumbs gave.

For the main part of the meal I ordered  the Steak & Frites. This was a 16 ounce rib eye served with a stack of shoestring potatoes. I was not sure about the potatoes , as shoestring is not usually what I would pick . They were good , nicely brown and crisp !  Not over cooked ! The rib eye was nicely seared and cooked prefectly! It was very tender , almost melt in the mouth! 

To drink I ordered a long island ice tea and coffee.  The long island ice tea was served in a jelly jar , and cost more than their specialty drinks!  Note to self , stick with just coffee here !  The coffee is very good!

Someone next to me ordered the pasta primavera ,it looked very good and they said that it was tasty! Maybe I will try it on my next visit!

We've been thinking of getting another car sometime this year. We occasionally will test drive cars to see what we like so we can plan. A week ago we went to Mercedes Benz of Reno and were greeted by Alfredo Hernandez, one of their sales people. He was friendly, knowledgeable and pleasant. My husband wanted to test drive a used Mercedes CL550 they had on their lot which we did.

Afterwards, while they talked about various cars, etc, I noticed Alfredo had sold a Toyota 4-Runner (they have a screen showing daily sales)and was surprised why someone would go there for a Toyota. I asked about other used cars on the lot besides Mercedes. We stepped outside and saw an Acura MDX, exactly the color I love inside and out. 

We weren't planning to buy a car that day, but my husband had been telling me I would love an MDX. He was right. This car is immaculate, has every option available and drives like a dream. 

Alfredo helped us get the price down (it was already below Kelley Blue Book and they came down $2K more). They put 4 brand new tires on it, washed it and filled the tank. It was a Saturday at 4pm so a loan that day was not easy. We had the option to put the car on hold and look for a loan ourselves on Monday or they said we could go with what they could offer and THEY would look for a better one on Monday for us through a credit union. I was skeptical, but we decided to go for it. 

On Tuesday at noon I got a text from Alfredo that they found us a better loan. I went by that evening to sign new papers and they had gotten us a loan for almost half the rate! It was easy and we never felt pressured. I can't believe the easy, comfortable experience and the wonderful people we delt with, especially Alfredo. I recommend that if you're in the market for a new or used car you stop by and ask for him. 

One more thing...they called me yesterday to set up a free inspection and full wash in 6 months, just to be sure everything is still going great! Quite a different experience than anything in the past.",1,GPz4XuR81_GAzjkajgdTBg

I can personally vouch for John who treated me- I have been having abdominal discomfort for weeks, even went to a GI specialist and had an ultrasound, to no avail- John found a twist in my lower intestine and moved it. I have felt 100% better since. Therapeutic massage treatment isn't always comfortable, it's not like a spa massage. It works on your muscles and core issues. The therapists at the Rubin center are masters and I'm glad we tried their services.

As for the chiropractic care, Dr. Rubin was great. He believes in diagnosing the problem and creating a long-term solution, rather than just adjusting you to fix the symptoms.

Certain times of the year I love going there for their evening concerts. I love the animals and a small quaint little shops they have.

I think Busch Gardens is the best amusement park in all of Florida but that is just my humble opinion. On the other hand I also think it is gone down and quality since I have been going to visit it for so many years. The rides are not my thing except for some of the specialty ones so I'm going more on the quality of the overall park.

Yes I like that they have the beer and some nice restaurants but I wouldn't say I've eaten at any restaurant there that is a five star quality but once again that's my opinion. Personally I think the animals and walking around in nature and enjoying yourself with friends and or family is a wonderful way to spend a day or an evening. So what better place to do it if you're in Tampa then Busch Gardens.

It if you coming to Florida it's definitely something to put on your must do list because its so unique. Some of us that have been around for years no the changes and noticed them but it's not going to stop us from going or at least not me. I do regret some of the changes I see but, that's not my decision to make, its corporate America.

Who would have thought to combine spicy, salty, sweet, sour, and bitter flavors ALL in one dish?!? However, since that initial encounter, I have found it difficult to locate quality Thai food that can reignite that first fire. Smile Café is no exception.

I gotta give it to them though - $7.95 for a lunch special with an entrée and two sides is a pretty awesome deal. But I found the lemongrass soup just a tad too watery, the dumplings just a hair too soggy, and the drunken noodles just a bit too mushy. They did succeed in making it quite spicy (with actual chili peppers, not just flakes!), but when I order a 5-star spice dish at a Thai restaurant, I kind of expect to be incapacitated, maybe comatose, and all I did was minimally perspire (like somewhere in between nervous first date sweats and ""I just walked up three flights of stairs and am trying to pretend I'm less tired than I actually am""). 

It is possible that I'm treating Thai food like my favorite, pretty, athletic, straight-A child. I may be holding it to a higher standard just because I see so much potential. So take it all with a grain of salt, but this is my review, and I'm sticking to it!",2,DvP8pq7QzV11_0968ahxMQ

In all fairness it was their first night, open to the public. My husband and I walked in with no reservation but was seated promptly at the bar. The ambience was very communal, big benches/booths seating 6-8 alongside the bar and smaller tables scattered about. The lighting was great but I searched for any hint of Mexican flare and found none. Maybe they haven't fully decorated although I did like that it was minimal versus overly done stereotypical decor. We were attended by a young woman named Anna at the bar w cute tortoise shelled rimmed glasses. I point her out because she was fantastic. Kept her cool even when the kitchen made some initial mixups, was very descriptive in her fave dishes and drinks and overall very accommodating.  To start the guacamole was very good (chunky, flavorful not too salty), we ordered the carne asada tacos and the chicken enchilada. We waited almost an hour for our meal and then they only brought out tacos but no enchilada. Unfortunately we couldn't wait any longer and asked Anna to cancel our order but to her and our surprise after the initial mixup the kitchen never fulfilled the enchilada order anyway so no harm no foul. My husband and I ended up sharing the tacos which were delicious and I wish we could have tried the enchilada. Not long before I was telling my husband that the manager should have come over did Anna say that owner, George was on his way and they would comp our meal. The first is a sign of great service while the latter was an over and beyond awesome gesture. We of course left a generous tip and will be back. I highly recommend, the flavors were great. Our red sangria was good and the margarita was strong!

In my experience, the front desk was distracted and just about business; inhospitable. I got treated in a more friendly way by the girl who was training than by the guy training her when checking in.

The hotel evening lounge service was pathetically slow and inattentive, forgetting to bring some items, getting others wrong, and even not bringing our drinks because they thought we had left when we had moved ONE table over. Service at the bar was efficient, although I could hear a bartender grumble about having to do table service. 

The shining star of the lounge / bar was Sarah, who served me breakfast twice and was the saving grace of this hotel's service. She was super hospitable, pleasant, swift, caring, and competent in her service. Having her be my server was truly a highlight of staying here. Thanks again, Sarah.

The air conditioning here is awesome though, the place is very clean and tidy, and the maid staff are very nice and cool. I was super happy with my room and the cleanliness of the hotel. 

The piece that got me to write this review was the bellman by the front door who complained under his breath when I asked him to hold on to my luggage since I had already checked out. 

Ultimately, a sense of inhospitableness pervades this hotel, with rare exceptions (like Sarah).

My favorite part of Sojourner was definitely the wall decor... all of the past Summer Solstice parade flyers and posters adorn the walls, which was very nostalgic for me, having grown up in Santa Barbara. 

My negative critiques:
1. The side of tempeh was a touch too spicy. (Other reviewers on Yelp noted the same.) 

2. There was an individual at my table with a corn allergy, whom alerted the waitress to the issue and substituted pita bread for a corn tortilla in the Tempeh Taco... but failed to note that there is corn mixed into the Tempeh, which later caused a health problem.

3. The decor, minus the amazing posters, could use a bit of updating. Great location with great potential.

I was tempted to have an 8 oz. cheese steak for $8.00 and some waffle fries for $3.00, since I couldn't have either Pat's Steaks or Geno's Steaks.  The line at Jim's was ridiculously long and I only came to Philly to try some new things.   I'm glad I didn't eat here and made my way to Chinatown/Central Bus Terminal to buy my $12 ticket to NYC from New Century Travel (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/new-century-travel-philadelphia#hrid:1yMuskM0o_71MruWlD9n_A ) AND have dinner at the nearby PENANG Malaysian Restaurant (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/eaDZlSuVS0EY67Ke6pRP6Q#hrid:UEjutZTzbs7y4GtH0PX1Mg  ).  Penang was great.  Sugarmom's not so...

Highlights:
+ Graffiti is tolerated and I think welcome in this underground joint
+ Playboy centerfold wallpaper adorned with graffiti in the upstairs men's room
+ Japanese collage of MAZINGER Z and various Voltron-like robots in the upstairs foyer -- totally cool...

Unfortunatley, I wasn't able to make it to North Bowl (see: http://www.yelp.com/biz/R0JUjyjGEzUlY3auVhY_tg ) to check out their pinball machines.  Maybe next time!

site: http://www.stlouiscinemas.com

I love this place - hands down. Its 15-20 mins from my home and a huge screen with leather couches. Where else can you sit on a leather couch, drink beer from the tap, and enjoy a heart pounding experience. 

Last movie I saw there was Transformers 2 and I was very impressed. 

Final note: You can go bowling downstairs when your though with the movie if you like. So if you bring a group of friends to an hot movie (say like Tron 2.0 coming this December???) then you go get some brews and try your hand at a strike or two afterwords.

See you at the Moolah!",1,rMEZisYcS-4kpzn_R54cbA

I want to be very clear and fair...In NOLA to celebrate my birthday and this was to be the special birthday meal. We were so excited but experienced a colossal disappointment. Gentlemen at front (proprietor?)  was ok initially-acknowledged my birthday and even put some confetti on the table. Very nice. That was the end of any niceties. This waitstaff was cold and apathetic. Receipt says Benjamin was our server. Honestly, he was the worst but at least he actually spoke to us. Assistant (water, bread, dessert never spoke a word and food runner practically threw dessert on the table). About the food - I had the beet and fried goat cheese salad which was lovely but very short on beets. Proportion of frisée to beet was out of wack but when you got it all in your mouth it was delicious. We also had the scallop appetizer which seemed to have three totally different sized scallops that cooked differently (perfect to chewy) but sausage with it was tasty. Veal cheeks were a very generous portion and perfectly braised; but the tarragon was overwhelming and root veggies way undercooked; so I swapped with my husband who ordered the snapper which was good. We ordered creme brûlée which was burnt and bitter. Benjamin saw we only ate two bites and did actually ask if we liked it (first time he did that with any of the food or wines we ordered). When we told him we thought it was burnt he just said he would take it off the bill. No  ""I'm sorry"" or ""Would you like to try something else?"" He just took it away. We eat at a LOT of great restaurants in NOLA. This was the Solid worst. Also dark and loud. Bad energy. Felt total disdain from all staff. In such a diverse town known for its food and hospitality we picked the one homogenous place that didn't care if we lived or died. So be it.

The food was given to us hot and fresh, and the orders were correct. It was $20 for 2 combos, so definitely on the more expensive side of fast food, but the portions were HUGE. Ridiculously so. I barely could fit the drinks in the cup holders.

The burgers were really greasy and messy but tasted okay, if I didn't know better I would assume they were Burger King. The regular fries were nothing to write home about, but the criss-cut fries were really good.

Unless you want to try one of their ""specialty"" burgers like the jalapeño/guac or Texas burger, don't be shocked when it tastes very familiar.",0,bzCC55PuuDH13NFxKpSJ_A

1. Cleanliness; the floors and walls look so dirty!

In the back room, the dirtiness is completed with a single fan full of dust.
2. I've always been too afraid to order food here, from the small open kitchen, general uncleanliness, and inattentiveness of the barista.
3. The espresso has been too bitter every time- if you can ever get it delivered. I always feel as though I am burdening the barista, even if I am the only customer in line. 

Also- if you are looking for a quiet place to work on your laptop, this is not the place. The back room is unclean, never quiet enough, atmosphere is awful, and there's no air flow.
