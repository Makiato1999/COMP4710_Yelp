## How To Run
The program has been seperated into 3 stages. Note that at the end of the first stage, we randomly select a specific amount of data, so every different run will produce a different result.

### Prerequisites
- Jupyter Notebook
    - Jupyter notebook is required for running the code. 
- Yelp Datasets
    - The size of Yelp datasets is too large which exceed the GitHub maximum upload file size. So to be able to run the code, it is required to download the [datasets from Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset).
    - In this program we only need business.json and review.json.
    
### Instructions
